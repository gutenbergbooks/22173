<h1><a name="THE_GRELL_MYSTERY" id="THE_GRELL_MYSTERY"></a>THE GRELL MYSTERY</h1>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I</h2>


<p>Outside the St. Jermyn's Club the rain pelted pitilessly upon deserted
pavements. Mr. Robert Grell leaned his arms on the table and stared
steadily out through the steaming window-panes for a second. His
shoulders lifted in a shrug that was almost a shiver.</p>

<p>"It's a deuce of a night," he exclaimed with conviction.</p>

<p>There was a faint trace of accent in his voice&mdash;an almost imperceptible
drawl, such as might remain in the speech of an American who had
travelled widely and rubbed shoulders with all sorts and conditions of
men.</p>

<p>His companion lifted his eyebrows whimsically and nipped the end from a
cigar.</p>

<p>"It is," he agreed. "But the way you put it is more like plain Bob Grell
of the old days than the polished Mr. Robert Grell, social idol,
millionaire and diplomat, and winner of the greatest matrimonial prize
in London."</p>

<p>Grell tugged at his drooping iron-grey moustache. "That's all right," he
said. "This is not a meeting of the Royal Society. Here, in my own club,
I claim the right of every free-born citizen to condemn the weather&mdash;or
anything else&mdash;in any language I choose. Great<!-- Page 2 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span> Scott, Fairfield! You
don't expect me to wear my mantle all the time. I should explode if I
didn't have a safety valve."</p>

<p>Sir Ralph Fairfield nodded. He understood. For years the two had been
close friends, and in certain phases of temperament they were much
alike. Both had tasted deeply of the sweets and hardships of life. Both
had known the fierce wander-lust that drives men into strange places to
suffer hunger, thirst, hardship and death itself for the sheer love of
the game, and both had achieved something more than national fame.
Fairfield as a fertile writer on ethnography and travel; and Grell
equally as a daring explorer, and as a man who had made his mark in the
politics and finance of the United States. More than once he had been
employed on delicate diplomatic missions for his Government, and always
he had succeeded. Great things were within his reach when he had
suddenly announced his intention of giving up business, politics and
travel to settle in England and lead the life of a gentleman of leisure.
He had bought a thousand acres in Sussex, and rented a town house in
Grosvenor Gardens.</p>

<p>Then he had met Lady Eileen Meredith, daughter of the Duke of Burghley.
Like others, he had fallen a victim to her grey eyes. The piquant
beauty, the supple grace, the intangible charm of the girl had aroused
his desire. A man who always achieved his ends, he set himself to woo
and win her with fierce impetuosity. He had won. Now he was spending his
last night of bachelordom at his club.</p>

<p>A man of about forty-five, he carried himself well and the evening dress
he wore showed his upright muscular<!-- Page 3 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span> figure to advantage. Every movement
he made had a swift grace that reminded one irresistibly of a tiger,
with its suggestion of reserve force. His close-cropped hair and a
drooping moustache were prematurely grey. He had a trick of looking at
one through half-closed eyelids that gave the totally erroneous
impression that he was half asleep. The face was square, the chin
dogged, the lips, half-hidden by the moustache, thin and tightly pressed
together. He was the type of man who emerges victor in any contest,
whether of wits or muscle. Plain and direct when it suited his purpose;
subtle master of intrigue when subtlety was needed.</p>

<p>A nervous gust of wind flung the rain fiercely against the window. Sir
Ralph Fairfield uncrossed his knees with care for the scrupulous crease
in his trousers.</p>

<p>"You're a great man, Bob," he said slowly. "You take it quite as a
matter of course that you should win the prettiest girl in the three
kingdoms." His voice became meditative. "I wonder how married life will
suit you. You know, you're not altogether the type of a man one
associates with the domestic hearthstone."</p>

<p>Their eyes met. The twinkle of humour which was in the baronet's did not
reflect itself in the other's. Grell, too, was wondering whether he was
fitted for domestic life. He had a taste for introspection, and was
speculating how far the joyous girl who had confided her heart to his
keeping would fit in with the scheme of things. He roused himself with
an effort and glanced at his watch. It was half-past nine.</p>

<p>"You make a mistake, Fairfield," he laughed.<!-- Page 4 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span> "Eileen and I fit each
other, and you'll see we'll settle down all right. Care to see the
present I'm giving her to-morrow? It's to be a little surprise. Look
here!"</p>

<p>He inserted a hand in his breast pocket and produced a flat case of blue
Morocco leather. He touched a spring: "There!"</p>

<p>Soft, shimmering white against the sombre velvet lining reposed a string
of pearls which even the untrained eye of Fairfield knew must be of
enormous value. Each gem was perfect in its soft purity, and they had
been matched with scrupulous care. Grell picked it up and dangled it on
his forefinger, so that the crimson glow of the shaded electric lights
was reflected in the smooth surface of the jewels.</p>

<p>"Pretty toy, isn't it?" he commented. "I gave Streeters <i>carte blanche</i>
to do the best they could."</p>

<p>He dropped the necklace carelessly back in its case, snapped the catch,
and placed it in his pocket. Fairfield's jerk of the head was
significant.</p>

<p>"And you are fool enough to carry the thing around loose in your pocket.
Good heavens, man! Do you know that there are people who would not stick
at murder to get a thing like that?"</p>

<p>The other laughed easily. "Don't you worry, Fairfield. You're the only
person I've shown it to, and I'm not afraid you'll sandbag me." He
changed the subject abruptly. "By the way, I've got an engagement I want
to keep. Do you mind answering the telephone if I'm rung up by any one?
Say I'm here, but I'm frightfully busy clearing up some business
matters, will you?"</p>

<p>The baronet frowned half in perplexity, half in pro<!-- Page 5 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>test. "Why&mdash;forgive
me, Bob&mdash;why not say that you are gone out to keep an appointment?"</p>

<p>Grell was plainly a little embarrassed, but he strove to disguise the
fact. "Oh, it's only a fancy of mine," he retorted lightly. "I shan't be
gone long. You'll do it, won't you?"</p>

<p>"Of course," agreed Sir Ralph, still frowning.</p>

<p>"That's all right, then. Thanks. I'll be back in half an hour."</p>

<p>He strode away with an abrupt nod. Shortly afterwards Fairfield heard a
taxicab scurry away down the sodden street. He leaned back in his chair
and puffed a cloud of smoke towards the ceiling. There was a dim
uneasiness in his mind, though he could have given no reason for it. He
picked up an evening paper and threw it aside. Then he strolled up into
the cardroom and tried to interest himself in watching a game of bridge.
But the play only bored him. Time hung heavily on his hands. A servant
spoke to him. Instantly he rose and made his way to the telephone. A
call had been made for Grell.</p>

<p>"Hello! Is that you, dear? This is Eileen speaking.... I can't hear.
What do you say?"</p>

<p>It was the clear, musical voice of the girl Robert Grell was to marry.
Fairfield wondered if his friend had expected this.</p>

<p>"This is not Mr. Grell," he said. "This is Fairfield&mdash;Sir Ralph
Fairfield&mdash;speaking."</p>

<p>"Oh!" He could detect the disappointment in her voice. "Is he there? I
am Lady Eileen Meredith."</p>

<p>Fairfield mentally cursed the false position in which he found himself.
He was usually a ready-witted man,<!-- Page 6 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span> but now he found himself stammering
almost incoherently.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;no&mdash;yes. He is here, Lady Eileen, but he has a guest whom it is
impossible for him to leave. It's a matter of settling up an important
diplomatic question, I believe. Can I give him any message?"</p>

<p>"No, thank you, Sir Ralph." The voice had become cold and dignified. He
could picture her chagrin, and again anathematised Grell in his
thoughts. "Has he been there long? When do you think he will be free?"</p>

<p>"I can't say, I'm sure. He met me here for dinner at seven and has been
here since."</p>

<p>He hung up the receiver viciously. He had not expected to have to lie to
Grell's <i>fianc&eacute;e</i> when he had promised not to disclose his friend's
absence from the club. It was too bad of Grell. His eye met the clock,
and with a start he realised that it was a few minutes to eleven
o'clock. Grell had been gone an hour and a half.</p>

<p>"Queer chap," he murmured to himself, as he lit a fresh cigar and
selected a comfortable chair in the deserted smoking-room. "He's
certainly in love with her all right, but it's strange that he should
have used me to put her off to-night like that. Wonder what it means."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Two hours later a wild-eyed, breathless servant bareheaded in the
pouring rain, was stammering incoherently to a police-constable in
Grosvenor Gardens that Mr. Robert Grell had been found murdered in his
study.<!-- Page 7 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>


<p>The shattering ring of the telephone awoke Heldon Foyle with a start.
There was only one place from which he was likely to be rung up at one
o'clock in the morning, and he was reaching for his clothes with one
hand even while he answered.</p>

<p>"That you, sir?"... The voice at the other end was tremulous and
excited. "This is the Yard speaking&mdash;Flack. Mr. Grell, the American
explorer, has been killed&mdash;murdered ... yes ... at his house in
Grosvenor Gardens. The butler found him...."</p>

<p>When a man has passed thirty years in the service of the Criminal
Investigation Department at New Scotland Yard his nerves are pretty well
shock-proof. Few emergencies can shake him&mdash;not even the murder of so
distinguished a man as Robert Grell. Heldon Foyle gave a momentary gasp,
and then wasted no further time in astonishment. There were certain
obvious things to be done at once. For, up to a point, the science of
detection is merely a matter of routine. He flung back his orders curtly
and concisely.</p>

<p>"Right. I'm coming straight down. I suppose the local division inspector
is on it. Send for Chief Inspector Green and Inspector Waverley, and let
the finger-print people know. I shall want one of their best men. Let
one of our photographers go to the house and wait for me. Send a
messenger to Professor Harding, and<!-- Page 8 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span> telephone to the assistant
commissioner. Tell any of the people who are at the house not to touch
anything and to detain every one there. And Flack&mdash;Flack. Not a word to
the newspaper men. We don't want any leakage yet."</p>

<p>He hung up the receiver and began to dress hurriedly, but methodically.
He was a methodical man. Resolutely he put from his mind all thoughts of
the murder. No good would come of spinning theories until he had all the
available facts.</p>

<p>For ten years Heldon Foyle had been the actual executive chief of the
Criminal Investigation Department. He rarely wore a dressing-gown and
never played the violin. But he had a fine taste in cigars, and was as
well-dressed a man as might be found between Temple Bar and Hyde Park
Corner. He did not wear policemen's boots, nor, for the matter of that,
would he have allowed any of the six hundred odd men who were under his
control to wear them. He would have passed without remark in a crowd of
West-end clubmen. It is an aim of the good detective to fit his
surroundings, whether they be in Kensington or the Whitechapel Road.</p>

<p>A suggestion of immense strength was in his broad shoulders and deep
chest. His square, strong face and heavy jaw was redeemed from sternness
by a twinkle of humour in the eyes. That same sense of humour had often
saved him from making mistakes, although it is not a popular attribute
of story-book detectives. His carefully kept brown moustache was
daintily upturned at the ends. There was grim tenacity written all over
the man, but none but his intimates<!-- Page 9 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span> knew how it was wedded to pliant
resource and fertile invention.</p>

<p>Down a quiet street a motor-car throbbed its way and stopped before the
door of his quiet suburban home. It had been sent from Scotland Yard.</p>

<p>"Don't worry about speed limits," he said quietly as he stepped in.
"Refer any one to me who tries to stop you. Get to Grosvenor Gardens as
quickly as you can."</p>

<p>The driver touched his hat, and the car leapt forward with a jerk. A man
with tenderer nerves than Foyle would have found it a startling journey.
They swept round corners almost on two wheels, skidded on the greasy
roads, and once narrowly escaped running down one of London's outcasts
who was shuffling across the road with the painful shamble that seems to
be the hall-mark of beggars and tramps. Few, save policemen on night
duty, were about to mark their wild career.</p>

<p>As they drew up before the pillared portico of the great house in
Grosvenor Gardens a couple of policemen moved out of the shadow of the
railing and saluted.</p>

<p>Foyle nodded and walked up the steps. The door had flown open before he
touched the bell, and a lanky man with slightly bent shoulders was
outlined in the radiant glow of the electric light. It was Bolt, the
divisional detective inspector, a quiet, grave man who, save on
exceptional occasions, was with his staff responsible for the
investigation of all crime in his district.</p>

<p>"You're the first to come, sir," he said in a quiet, melancholy tone.
"It's a terrible job, this."</p>

<p>He spoke professionally. Living as they do in an atmosphere of crime,
always among major and minor<!-- Page 10 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span> tragedies, C.I.D. men&mdash;official detectives
prefer the term&mdash;are forced to view their work objectively, like doctors
and journalists. All murders are terrible&mdash;as murders. A detective
cannot allow his sympathies or sensibility to pain or grief to hamper
him in his work. In Bolt's sense the case was terrible because it was
difficult to investigate; because, unless the perpetrators were
discovered and arrested, discredit would be brought upon the service and
glaring contents-bills declare the inefficiency of the department to the
world. The C.I.D. is very jealous of its reputation.</p>

<p>"Yes," agreed Foyle. "Where is the butler? He found the body, I'm told.
Fetch him into some room where I can talk to him."</p>

<p>The butler, a middle-aged man, nervous, white-faced and half-distracted,
was brought into a little sitting-room. His eyes moved restlessly to and
from the detective: his fingers were twitching uneasily.</p>

<p>Foyle shot one swift appraising glance at him. Then he nodded to a
chair.</p>

<p>"Sit down, my man," he said, and his voice was silky and smooth. "Get
him a drink, Bolt. He'll feel better after that. Now, what's your
name?&mdash;Wills?&mdash;Pull yourself together. There's nothing to be alarmed
about. Just take your own time and tell us all about it."</p>

<p>There was no hint of officialdom in his manner. It was the sympathetic
attitude of one friend towards another. Wills gulped down a strong
mixture of brandy and soda which Bolt held out to him, and a tinge of
colour returned to his pale cheeks.</p>

<p>"It was awful, sir&mdash;awful," he said shakily. "Mr. Grell came in shortly
before ten, and left word that<!-- Page 11 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span> if a lady came to see him she was to be
brought straight into his study. She drove up in a motor-car a few
minutes afterwards and went up to him."</p>

<p>"What was her name? What was she like?" interrupted Bolt. Foyle held up
his hand warningly to his subordinate.</p>

<p>Wills quivered all over, and words forsook him for a moment. Then he
went on&mdash;</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I don't know. Ivan, Mr. Grell's valet, let her in. I saw her pass
through the hall. She was tall and slim, but she wore a heavy veil, so I
didn't see her face. I don't know when she left, but I went up to the
study at one o'clock to ask if anything was needed before I went to bed.
I could get no answer, although I knocked loudly two or three times; so
I opened the door. My God! I..."</p>

<p>He flung his hands over his eyes and collapsed in an infantile paroxysm
of tears.</p>

<p>Foyle rose and touched him gently on the shoulder. "Yes, then?"</p>

<p>"The room was only dimly lit, sir, and I could see that he was lying on
the couch, rather awkwardly, his face turned from me. I thought he might
have dozed off, and I went into the room and touched him on the
shoulder. My hand came away wet!" His voice rose to a scream. "It was
blood&mdash;blood everywhere&mdash;and he with a knife in his heart."</p>

<p>Foyle leaned over the table. "Where's Ivan?&mdash;Russian, I suppose, by the
name? He must be about the house somewhere."</p>

<p>"I haven't seen him since he let the lady in," faltered the butler.<!-- Page 12 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p>The superintendent never answered. Bolt had silently disappeared. For
five minutes silence reigned in the little room. Then the door was
pushed open violently and Bolt entered like a stone propelled from a
catapult.</p>

<p>"Ivan has gone&mdash;vanished!" he cried.<!-- Page 13 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>


<p>Foyle caressed his chin with his well-manicured hand.</p>

<p>"H'm!" he said reflectively. "Don't let's jump to conclusions too
quickly, Mr. Bolt. There's a doctor here, I suppose? Take this man to
him, and when he's a bit calmer take a statement from him. I'll leave
Ivan to you. Get some of the servants to give you a description of him,
and 'phone it through to Flack at the Yard. Let him send it out as an
'all station' message, and get in touch with the railway stations. The
chap can't have got far. Detain on suspicion. No arrest. Hello, there's
the bell. That's some of our people, I expect. All right, I'll answer.
You get on with that."</p>

<p>He had not raised his voice in giving his directions. He was as cool and
matter-of-fact as a business man giving instructions to his secretary,
yet he was throwing a net round London. Within five minutes of the time
Bolt had gathered his description, the private telegraph that links
Scotland Yard with all the police stations of London would be setting
twenty thousand men on the alert for the missing servant. The great
railway stations would be watched, and every policeman and detective
wherever he might be stationed would know exactly the appearance of the
man wanted, from the colour of his hair and his eyes to the pattern of
his socks.</p>

<p>Foyle opened the door to a little cluster of grave-<!-- Page 14 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>faced men. Sir
Hilary Thornton, the assistant commissioner, was there; Professor
Harding, an expert retained by the authorities, and a medical man whose
scientific researches in connection with the Gould poisoning case had
sent a man to the gallows, and whose aid had been most important in
solving many murder mysteries; Grant of the finger-print department, a
wizard in all matters relating to identification; a couple of men from
his department bearing cameras, and lastly the senior officer of the
Criminal Investigation Department, Green, and his assistant, Waverley.</p>

<p>Sir Hilary drew Foyle a little aside, and they conversed in low tones.
Professor Harding, with a nod to the superintendent, had gone upstairs
to where the divisional surgeon and another doctor were waiting with
Lomont, the secretary of the murdered man, outside the door of the room
where Robert Grell lay dead.</p>

<p>The doctors had done no more than ascertain he was dead, and Foyle
himself had purposely not gone near the room until Harding had an
opportunity of making his examinations.</p>

<p>"I shall take charge of this myself, if you do not mind, Sir Hilary,"
Foyle was saying. "Mainland is capable of looking after the routine work
of the department, and in the case of a man of Mr. Grell's
importance&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That is what I should have suggested," said Sir Hilary. "We must get to
the bottom of this at all costs. You know Mr. Grell was to have been
married to Lady Eileen Meredith at St. Margaret's, Westminster, this
morning. It's a bad business. Let's see what Harding's got to say."<!-- Page 15 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p>Their feet sank noiselessly into the thick carpet of the stairs as they
moved towards the death-chamber. From an open doorway near the landing a
flood of light issued.</p>

<p>"Very handy for any one to get away," commented Foyle. "The stairs lead
direct to the hall, and there are only two rooms to pass. This carpet
would deaden footsteps too."</p>

<p>They entered softly. Some one had turned all the lights on in the room,
and it was bathed in brilliance.</p>

<p>A dying fire flickered in the grate; bookcases lined the red-papered
walls, which were broken here and there by curios and sporting trophies
gathered from many countries. There were a few etchings, which had
evidently been chosen with the skill of a connoisseur.</p>

<p>Parallel with the window was a desk, scrupulously tidy. Half a dozen
chairs were scattered about, and in a recess was a couch, over which the
angular frock-coated figure of Professor Harding was bent. He looked up
as the two men approached.</p>

<p>"It's clearly murder," he said. "He was probably killed between ten and
eleven&mdash;stabbed through the heart. Curious weapon used too&mdash;look!"</p>

<p>He moved aside and for the first time Foyle got a view of the body.
Robert Grell lay sprawled awkwardly on the couch, his face turned
towards the wall, one leg trailing on the floor. A dark crimson stain
soiled the white surface of his shirt, and one side of his dinner jacket
was wringing wet. The dagger still remained in the wound, and it was
that riveted Foyle's attention. He stepped back quickly to one of the
men at the door.<!-- Page 16 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<p>"Send Mr. Grant to me," he ordered.</p>

<p>Returning to the body, he gently withdrew the knife, handling it with
the most delicate care. "I've never seen anything like this before," he
said. "Queer thing, isn't it?"</p>

<p>It was a sheath knife with a blade of finely tempered steel about three
inches long and as sharp as a razor. Its abnormality lay in a hilt of
smooth white ivory set horizontally and not vertically to the blade, as
is a rule with most knives.</p>

<p>Foyle carried it in the palm of his hand nearer to the light and
squinted at it from various angles. One at least of the observers
guessed his purpose. But the detective seemed dissatisfied.</p>

<p>"Can't see anything," he grumbled peevishly. "Ah, there you are, Grant.
I want to see whether we can make anything of this. Let me have a little
graphite, will you?"</p>

<p>The finger-print expert took an envelope from his pocket and handed it
to the superintendent. From it Foyle scattered fine black powder on the
hilt. A little cry of satisfaction came from his lips as he blew the
stuff away in a little dark cloud. Those in the room crowded around.</p>

<p>Outlined in black against the white surface of the ivory were four
finger-prints. The two centre ones were sharp and distinct, the outside
prints were fainter and more blurred.</p>

<p>"By Jove, that's good!" exclaimed the professor.</p>

<p>Foyle rubbed his chin and handed the weapon to Grant without replying.
"Get one of your men to photograph those and have them enlarged. At any<!-- Page 17 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
rate, it's something to go on with. It would be as well to compare 'em
with the records, though I doubt whether that will be of much use." He
drew his watch from his pocket and glanced at it. "Now, if you will
excuse me, gentlemen, I should like to have the room to myself for a
little while. And, Grant, send Green and the photographer up, and tell
Waverley to act with Bolt in examining the servants."</p>

<p>The room cleared. Harding lingered to exchange a few words with the
superintendent.</p>

<p>"I can do nothing, Mr. Foyle," he said. "From a medical point of view it
is all straightforward. There can be no question about the time and
cause of death. Good night,&mdash;or rather, good morning."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Mr. Harding, good morning."</p>

<p>His eyes were roving restlessly about the room, and he dictated the work
the photographer was to do with scrupulous care. Half a dozen times a
dazzling flash of magnesium powder lit up the place. Photographs of the
room in sections were being taken. Then with a curt order to the
photographer to return immediately to Scotland Yard and develop his
negatives, he drew up a chair to the couch and began to go methodically
through the pockets of the dead man.</p>

<p>Green stood by, a note-book in hand. Now and again Foyle dictated
swiftly. He was a man who knew the value of order and system. Every step
in the investigation of a crime is reduced to writing, collected,
indexed, and filed together, so that the whole history of a case is
instantly available at any time. He was carrying out the regular
routine.</p>

<p>Only two things of any consequence rewarded his<!-- Page 18 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span> search&mdash;one was a note
from Sir Ralph Fairfield confirming an appointment with Grell to dine at
the St. Jermyn's Club the previous evening; the other was a miniature
set in diamonds of a girl, dark and black-haired, with an insolent
piquant beauty.</p>

<p>"I've seen that face before somewhere," mused the superintendent.
"Green, there's a 'Who's Who' on the desk behind you. I want Sir Ralph
Fairfield."</p>

<p>Rapidly he scanned the score of lines of small type devoted to the
baronet. They told him little that he had not known before. Fairfield
was in his forty-third year, was the ninth baronet, and had great
estates in Hampshire and Scotland. He was a traveller and a student. His
town address was given as the Albany.</p>

<p>"You'd better go round to Fairfield's place, Green. Tell him what's
happened and bring him here at once."</p>

<p>As the chief inspector, a grim, silent man, left, Foyle turned again to
his work. He began a careful search of the room, even rummaging among
the litter in the waste-paper basket. But there was nothing else that
might help to throw the faintest light on the tragedy.</p>

<p>A discreet knock on the door preceded Waverley's entrance with a report
of the examination of every one in the house. He had gathered little
beyond the fact that Grell, when not concerned in social duties, was a
man of irregular comings and goings, and that Ivan, his personal valet,
was a man he had brought from St. Petersburg, who spoke French but
little English, and had consequently associated little with the other
servants.</p>

<p>Foyle subsided into his chair with his forehead puckered into a series
of little wrinkles. He rested his chin<!-- Page 19 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span> on his hand and gazed into
vacancy. There might be a hundred solutions to the riddle. Where was the
motive? Was it blackmail? Was it revenge? Was it jealousy? Was it
robbery? Was it a political crime? Was it the work of a madman? Who was
the mysterious veiled woman? Was she associated with the crime?</p>

<p>These and a hundred other questions beat insistently on his brain, and
to none of them could he see the answer. He pictured the queer dagger,
but flog his memory as he would he could not think where it might have
been procured. In the morning he would set a score of men making
inquiries at every place in London where such a thing was likely to have
been obtained.</p>

<p>He was in the position of a man who might solve a puzzle by hard,
painstaking experiment and inquiry, but rather hoped that some brilliant
flash of inspiration or luck might give him the key that would fit it
together at once. They rarely do come.</p>

<p>Once Lomont, Grell's secretary, knocked and entered with a question on
his lips. Foyle waved him impatiently away.</p>

<p>"I will see you later on, Mr. Lomont. I am too busy to see you now. Mr.
Waverley or Mr. Bolt will see to you."</p>

<p>The man vanished, and a moment or two later a discreet tap at the door
heralded the return of Green, accompanied by Sir Ralph Fairfield.</p>

<p>The baronet's hand was cold as it met that of Foyle, and his haggard
face was averted as though to avoid the searching gaze of the
detective.<!-- Page 20 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>


<p>Fairfield, awakened from sleep by the news of the murder of his friend,
had stared stupidly at the detective Foyle had sent to him.</p>

<p>"Grell killed!" he exclaimed, "Why, he was with me last night. It is
incredible&mdash;awful. Of course, I'll come at once&mdash;though I don't see what
use I can be. What time was he murdered?"</p>

<p>"About ten o'clock. So far as we know you were the last person to see
him alive&mdash;except the murderer," said Green. "Believe me, we're sorry to
have to trouble you."</p>

<p>The baronet's face had suddenly gone the colour of white paper. A
sickening dread had suddenly swept over him. His hands trembled as he
adjusted his overcoat. He remembered that he had assured Lady Eileen
that Grell had been with him at the club from six till eleven. What
complexion would that statement bear when it was exposed as a lie&mdash;in
the light of the tragedy? His throat worked as he realised that he might
even be suspected of the crime.</p>

<p>The ordinary person suddenly involved in the whirlpool of crime is
always staggered. There is ever the feeling, conscious or unconscious:
"Why out of so many millions of people should this happen to <i>me</i>?" So
it was with Sir Ralph Fairfield. He pictured the agony in Eileen
Meredith's eyes when she heard of the death of her lover, pictured her
denunciation of his lie. The<!-- Page 21 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span> truth would only sound lame if he were to
tell it. Who would believe it? Like a man stricken dumb he descended in
the lift with Green, out into the wild night in a taxicab, his thoughts
a chaos.</p>

<p>He was neither a coward nor a fool. He had known close acquaintance with
sudden death before. But that was different. It had not happened so. He
was incapable of connected thought. One thing only he was clear upon&mdash;he
must see Eileen, tell her the truth and throw himself on her mercy.
Meanwhile he would answer no questions until he had considered the
matter quietly.</p>

<p>This was his state of mind when he shook hands with Foyle. He had
schooled his voice, and it was in a quiet tone that he spoke.</p>

<p>"It's a horrible thing, this," he said, twirling his hat between his
long, nervous fingers.</p>

<p>Foyle was studying him closely. The movement of the hands was not lost
upon him.</p>

<p>"Yes," he agreed, stroking his chin. "I asked you to come here because
Mr. Grell dined with you last night. Do you know if he left you to keep
an appointment?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;that is, it might have been so. He left me, and I understood he
would be back. He did not return."</p>

<p>"At what time?"</p>

<p>Fairfield hesitated a second before replying. Then, "I haven't the
remotest idea."</p>

<p>The face of Foyle gave no indication of the surprise he felt. He did not
press the question, but slid off to another.<!-- Page 22 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do you know of any woman who was likely to visit him at that time of
night?"</p>

<p>"Great heavens, no, man! Do you suspect a woman? He&mdash;&mdash;" He checked
himself, and looked curiously at the detective. "Mr. Grell was a friend
of mine," he went on more quietly. "Things are bad enough as they are,
but you know that he had influential friends both here and in America.
They won't thank you, Mr. Foyle, for trying to go into such things."</p>

<p>Heldon Foyle's eyes lingered in quiet scrutiny on the other's face.</p>

<p>"I shall do what I consider to be my duty," he said, his voice a little
hard. "Come, Sir Ralph, you will see I must do my best to bring the
murderer of this man to justice. Had Mr. Grell any relations?"</p>

<p>"I don't believe there's one in the wide world."</p>

<p>"And you don't remember what time he left? Try, Sir Ralph. It is
important. Before you came I sent a man to the club, and none of the
servants recollects seeing either of you go. They say he was with you
most of the evening. You can clear up this matter of time."</p>

<p>"I don't remember what time he left me."</p>

<p>The baronet's voice was hoarse and strained. Foyle rose and stood
towering over him.</p>

<p>"You are lying," he said deliberately.</p>

<p>Sir Ralph recoiled as though he had been struck in the face. A quick
wave of crimson had mounted to his temples. Instinctively his hands
clenched. Then regaining a little control of himself he wheeled about
without a word. His hand was on the handle of the<!-- Page 23 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span> door when the
superintendent's suave voice brought him to a halt.</p>

<p>"Oh, by the way, Sir Ralph, you might look at this before you go, and
say whether you recognise it."</p>

<p>He held his clenched hand out, and suddenly unclasped it to disclose the
miniature set in diamonds.</p>

<p>Sir Ralph gave a start. "By Jove, it's little Lola of Vienna!" he
exclaimed. Then realised that he had been trapped. "But I shall tell you
nothing about her," he snapped.</p>

<p>"Thank you, Sir Ralph," said the other quietly.</p>

<p>"But this I think it right you should know," went on Fairfield, standing
with one hand still on the handle of the door: "When Grell was with me
last night he showed me a pearl necklace, which he said he had bought as
a wedding present for Lady Eileen Meredith. If you have not found it, it
may give you some motive for the tragedy."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Foyle unemotionally.<!-- Page 24 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>


<p>Day had long dawned ere Foyle and his staff had finished their work at
the great house in Grosvenor Gardens. There had been much to do, for
every person who might possibly throw a light on the tragedy had to be
questioned and requestioned. The place had been thoroughly searched from
attic to cellar, for letters or for the jewels that, if Sir Ralph
Fairfield were right, were missing.</p>

<p>Much more there would be to do, but for the moment they could go no
further. Foyle returned wearily to Scotland Yard to learn that of the
finger-prints on the dagger two were too blurred to serve for purposes
of identification. He ordered the miniature to be photographed, and held
a short consultation with the assistant commissioner. The watch kept for
Ivan had so far been without avail. In the corridor, early as it was, a
dozen journalists were waiting. Foyle submitted good-humouredly to their
questions as they grouped themselves about his room.</p>

<p>"Yes. Of course, I'll let you know all about it," he protested. "I'll
have the facts typed out for you, and you can embroider them yourselves.
There's a description of a man we'd like to get hold of&mdash;not necessarily
the murderer, but he might be an important witness. Be sure and put that
in."</p>

<p>He always had an air of engaging candour when<!-- Page 25 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span> dealing with newspaper
men. Sometimes they were useful, and he never failed to supply them with
just as much information about a case as would in any event leak out.
That saved them trouble and made them grateful. He went away now to have
the bare details of the murder put into shape. When he returned he held
the diamond-set miniature in his hand.</p>

<p>"This has been left at the Lost Property Office," he declared
unblushingly. "It's pretty valuable, so they've put it into our hands to
find the owner. Any of you boys know the lady?"</p>

<p>Some of them examined it with polite interest. They were more concerned
with the murder of a famous man. Lost trinkets were small beer at such
time. Only Jerrold of <i>The Wire</i> made any suggestion.</p>

<p>"Reminds me of that Russian princess woman who's been staying at the
Palatial, only it's too young for her. What's her name?&mdash;Petrovska, I
think."</p>

<p>"Thanks," said Foyle; "it doesn't matter much. Ah, here's your stuff.
Good-bye, boys, and don't worry me more than you can help. This thing is
going to keep us pretty busy."</p>

<p>He saw them out of the room and carefully closed the door. Sitting at
his desk he lifted the receiver from the telephone.</p>

<p>"Get the Palatial Hotel," he ordered. "Hello! That the Palatial? Is the
Princess Petrovska there? What? Left last night at ten o'clock? Did she
say where she was going? No, I see. Good-bye."</p>

<p>He scribbled a few words on a slip of paper, and touching the bell gave
it to the man who answered. "Send that to St. Petersburg at once."<!-- Page 26 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p>It was a communication to the Chief of the Russian police, asking that
inquiries should be made as to the antecedents of the Princess.</p>

<p>For the next three hours men were coming rapidly in and out of the
superintendent's office, receiving instructions and making reports.
Practically the whole of the six hundred men of the C.I.D. were engaged
on the case, for there was no avenue of investigation so slender but
that there might be something at the end of it. Neither Foyle nor his
lieutenants were men to leave anything to chance. Green was seated
opposite to him, discussing the progress they had made.</p>

<p>The superintendent leaned back wearily in his chair. Some one handed him
a slim envelope. He tore it open and slowly studied the cipher in which
the message was written. It read&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p style="text-indent: 2em;">"Silinsky, Chief of Police, St. Petersburg. To Foyle,
Superintendent C.I.D., London.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 5em; padding-right: 3em; text-indent: -2em;">"Woman you mention formerly Lola Rachael, believed born Paris;
formerly on stage, Vienna; married Prince Petrovska, 1898. Husband
died suddenly 1900. Travels much. No further particulars known."</p></blockquote>

<p>Foyle stroked his chin gravely. "Formerly Lola Rachael," he murmured.
"And Sir Ralph recognised the miniature as little Lola of Vienna. She's
worth looking after. We must find her, Green. What about this man Ivan?"</p>

<p>"No trace of him yet, sir, but I don't think he can<!-- Page 27 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span> give us the slip.
He hadn't much time to get away. By the way, sir, what do you think of
Sir Ralph?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. He's keeping something back for some reason. You'd better
have him shadowed, Green. Go yourself, and take a good man with you. He
mustn't be let out of sight night or day. I may tackle him again later
on."</p>

<p>"Very good, sir. Waverley's still at Grosvenor Gardens. Will you be
going back there?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. I want to look through the records of the Convict
Supervision Office for the last ten years. I have an idea that I may
strike something."</p>

<p>Green was too wise a man to ask questions of his chief. He slipped from
the room. Half an hour later Foyle dashed out of the room hatless, and,
picking up a taxicab, drove at top speed to Grosvenor Gardens. He was
greeted at the door by Lomont.</p>

<p>"What is it?" he demanded, the excitement of the detective communicating
itself to him. "Have you carried the case any further?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," replied the detective. "I must see the body again. Come
up with me."</p>

<p>In the death-chamber he carefully locked the door. A heavy ink-well
stood on the desk. He twisted up a piece of paper and dipped it in.
Then, approaching the murdered man, he smeared the fingers of his right
hand with the blackened paper and pressed them lightly on a piece of
blotting paper. The secretary, in utter bewilderment, watched him
compare the prints with a piece of paper he took from his pocket.</p>

<p>"What is it?" he repeated again.<!-- Page 28 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mr. Lomont," replied the detective gravely, "I wish I knew. Unless our
whole system of identification is wrong&mdash;and that is incredible&mdash;that
man who lies dead there is not Robert Grell."<!-- Page 29 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI</h2>


<p>Lomont reeled dizzily, and his hand sought the support of the wall. To
him Foyle's voice sounded unreal. He stared at the detective as though
doubtful of his sanity. His life had been hitherto ordered, placid. That
there were such things as crimes, murders, detectives, he knew. He had
read of them in the newspapers. But hitherto they had only been names to
him&mdash;something to make the paper more readable.</p>

<p>He was a thin-faced man of about thirty, with somewhat sallow cheeks on
which there was now a hectic flush, a high-pitched forehead that seemed
to have contracted into a perpetual frown, and colourless eyes. The son
of a well-known barrister, he had tried his luck in the City after
leaving Cambridge. In a few years the respectable income he had started
with had dwindled under the drain of his speculations, and it was then
that a friend had recommended him to Robert Grell, who was about to take
up his residence in England. James Lomont had jumped at the chance, for
the salary was respectable and would enable him to maintain a certain
footing in society.</p>

<p>"Not Robert Grell!" he echoed incredulously.</p>

<p>Foyle fancied that there was some quality other than incredulity in the
tone, but decided that he was mistaken. The young man's nerves were
shaken up. So far as time would allow he had gathered all there was to
know about him. Lomont had not escaped the net<!-- Page 30 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>work of inquiry that was
being woven about all who had associated with Robert Grell.</p>

<p>No fewer than three chapters in a book the Criminal Investigation
Department had commenced compiling were devoted to him. They lay with
others neatly typed and indexed in Heldon Foyle's office.</p>

<p>One was his signed statement of events on the night of the tragedy. The
last time he had seen Grell alive was at half-past six, when his
employer had left for the St. Jermyn's Club. He himself had gone to the
Savoy Theatre, and, returning some time after eleven, had let himself in
with his own key and gone straight to bed. He had only been aroused when
the police took possession of the house. The third was headed:
"Inquiries as to career of, and corroboration of statements made by,
James Lomont."</p>

<p>The curtains had remained drawn, and only a dim light filtered through
into the room. Foyle lifted a little green-shaded electric lamp from the
table, and switched on the light so that it fell on the face of the dead
man.</p>

<p>"Look," he said, in a quiet voice, "do you recognise your chief?"</p>

<p>The young man flung back his shoulders with a jerk, as though overcoming
his own feelings, and approached the body with evident distaste. His
hands, slender as a woman's, were tight-clenched, and his breath came
and went in nervous spasms. For a moment he gazed, and then shook his
head weakly.</p>

<p>"It is not," he whispered with dry lips. "There is an old scar across
the temple. Mr. Grell's face was not disfigured." He stretched out a
hand and clutched<!-- Page 31 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span> the superintendent nervously by the shoulder. "Who is
this man, Mr. Foyle? What does it all mean? Where is Mr. Grell?"</p>

<p>Foyle's hand had stolen to his chin and he rubbed it vigorously.</p>

<p>"I don't know what it means," he confessed irritably. "You know as much
as I do now. This man is not Robert Grell, though he is astonishingly
like him. Now, Mr. Lomont, I rely on you not to breathe a word of this
to a living soul until I give you permission. This secret must remain
between our two selves for the time being."</p>

<p>"Certainly."</p>

<p>In spite of his air of candour, Heldon Foyle had not revealed all he
knew. He left the house pondering deeply.</p>

<p>"You see, sir," he explained to the Assistant Commissioner later, "no
one who knew Grell had seen the body closely. The butler had taken it
for granted that it was his master. It was pure luck with me. In looking
through the records in search of this woman Petrovska, I hit against the
picture of Goldenburg. It was so like Grell that I went off at once to
compare finger-prints. They tallied; and then young Lomont spoke of the
scar. Though what Harry Goldenburg should be doing in Grell's house,
with Grell's clothes, and with Grell's property in the pockets, is more
than I can fathom."</p>

<p>Sir Hilary Thornton drummed on his desk with his right hand.</p>

<p>"Isn't this the Goldenburg who engineered the South American gold mine
swindle?" he asked.<!-- Page 32 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<p>"That's the man," agreed Foyle, not without a note of rueful admiration.
"He'd got half-a-dozen of the best-known and richest peers in England to
promise support, when we spoilt his game. No one would prosecute. He
always had luck, had Goldenburg. He's been at the back of a score of big
things, but we could never get legal proof against him. He was a cunning
rascal&mdash;educated, plausible, reckless. Well, he's gone now, and he's
given us as tough a nut to crack as ever he did while he was alive."</p>

<p>"How did you get his finger-prints if he was never convicted?" asked Sir
Hilary with interest.</p>

<p>Foyle looked his superior full in the face and smiled.</p>

<p>"I arrested him myself, on a charge of pocket-picking in Piccadilly," he
said. "Of course, he never picked a pocket in his life&mdash;he was too big a
crook for that. But we got a remand, and that gave us a chance to get
his photograph and prints for the records. We offered no evidence on the
second hearing. It was perhaps not strictly legal, but&mdash;&mdash;" The
superintendent's features relaxed into a smile. "He never brought an
action for malicious prosecution."</p>

<p>"And about Grell? How do you propose to find him?"</p>

<p>Foyle drew his chair up to the table and scribbled busily for a few
minutes on a sheet of paper. He carefully blotted it, and handed the
result of his labours to Sir Hilary, who nodded approval as he read it.</p>

<p>"You think we shall catch one man by advertising for another?"</p>

<p>"I think it worth trying, sir," retorted the superintendent curtly. "The
description and the photograph<!-- Page 33 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span> fit like a glove&mdash;and we shan't be
giving anything away."</p>

<p>As Heldon Foyle passed through the little back door leading to the
courtyard of Scotland Yard an hour later, he stopped for an instant to
study a poster that was being placed among the notices on the board in
the door. It ran:</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>


<p>The first grey daylight had found Sir Ralph Fairfield pacing his
sitting-room with uneven strides, his hands clasped behind his back, the
stump of a cold cigar between his teeth. His interview with Heldon Foyle
had not been calculated to calm him.</p>

<p>"I'm a fool&mdash;a fool," he told himself. "Why should they suspect me? What
have I to gain by Grell's death?"</p>

<p>It was the attitude of a man trying to convince himself. There was one
reason why he might be supposed to wish his friend out of the way, but
he dared not even shape the thought. There was one person who might
guess, and it was she whose lips he hoped to seal. A quick dread came to
him. Suppose the police had already gone to her. The thought stung him
to action. He had not even removed his hat and coat since his return
from Grosvenor Gardens. He made his way to the street and walked briskly
along until he sighted a taxicab.</p>

<p>"507 Berkeley Square," he told the driver.</p>

<p>It was a surprised footman who opened the door of the Duke of Burghley's
house. Fairfield, at the man's look of astonishment, remembered that he
was unshaven, and that his clothes had been thrown on haphazard. It was
a queer thought to intrude at such a time. But he was usually a
scrupulously dressed man, and the triviality worried him.<!-- Page 35 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>

<p>"Lady Eileen Meredith. I must see her at once," he said peremptorily.
"Don't stand staring at me, man. You know me."</p>

<p>The footman coughed apologetically.</p>

<p>"Yes, Sir Ralph. Lady Eileen is not up yet. If it is important I can get
a maid to call her. Shall I tell his Grace?"</p>

<p>"No. It is of the utmost importance that I see her personally
immediately."</p>

<p>Sir Ralph breathed a sigh of relief as he was ushered into the cool
morning room and the door closed behind him. At all events, the police
had not seen her yet. He was first. That meant he would have to break
the news to her. How would she take it?</p>

<p>"The poor little girl!" he muttered to himself. And then the door
clicked.</p>

<p>Eileen Meredith stood there, a pink dressing-gown enveloping her
graceful figure from shoulders to feet. There was questioning wonder in
her grey eyes as she extended her hand, but no alarm. He almost wished
there was. It would have made things easier.</p>

<p>"You, Sir Ralph?" she cried. "What has brought you here so early? Has
Bob repented of his bargain and sent you to call it off at the last
moment?"</p>

<p>The man fumbled for words. Now that he was face to face with her the
phrase he had so laboriously worked out to lead up to the news had
deserted him. He pushed a chair towards her.</p>

<p>"Er&mdash;won't you sit down?" he said awkwardly.</p>

<p>He was striving for an opening. Both words and tone called the girl's
direct attention to the haggard face, the feverish eyes. Her fears were
alight on the<!-- Page 36 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span> instant. She regarded him with parted lips and gripped
his arm impulsively.</p>

<p>"Something has happened!" she cried apprehensively. "Why do you look
like that? What is it?" Her voice rose and she tried to shake the silent
man. "Answer&mdash;why don't you answer? Is he ill&mdash;dead?"</p>

<p>Sir Ralph choked over his reply.</p>

<p>"He was killed last night&mdash;murdered."</p>

<p>It was out at last. He had blundered clumsily, and he knew it. The
colour drained from Eileen's face and she stood rigid as a statue for a
moment. Then slowly she swayed forward. He stretched out his arms to
prevent her from falling. She waved him aside dumbly and tottered to a
couch. His directness had been more merciful than he had thought. She
was stunned, dazed by her calamity. Her very silence frightened the man.
She sat bolt upright, her hand resting limply in her lap and her dull
eyes staring into vacancy. A tiny clock on the mantelpiece ticked
loudly.</p>

<p>"Dead!" she whispered at last. There was no trace of unsteadiness in her
voice and her eyes were dry. She spoke mechanically. "And it is our
wedding-day! Dead! Bob is dead?"</p>

<p>Her hair had fallen about her shoulders, and, beautiful in her grief,
she inspired the man with almost supernatural awe. He had moved to the
mantelpiece and, resting an arm upon it and one foot upon the fender,
remained looking down upon her. He was waiting until the first numbness
of the shock had passed. The little clock on the mantelpiece had ticked
out ten minutes ere she spoke again. But her voice was pitched<!-- Page 37 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span> in more
natural tones, and her face had regained something of its colour.</p>

<p>"How did it happen?"</p>

<p>Haltingly he gave such details as he knew. Her eyes were fixed on his
face as he narrated his story. He hesitated as he referred to his
telephone conversation with her. In her clear eyes he saw challenging
scorn and stopped abruptly.</p>

<p>"You say that Bob asked you to lie to me?" she demanded.</p>

<p>"Not to you in particular. To any one who rang up. I couldn't know
whether he wished his instructions to apply to you."</p>

<p>"No, no, of course not," she interposed quickly, but with a tightening
of the heart he recognised the bitterness of her tone. For all her soft
daintiness, there was something of the tigress in Eileen Meredith.</p>

<p>The man she loved was dead. Well, she would have her vengeance&mdash;somehow,
on some one. She was ready to suspect without thinking. And Sir Ralph
Fairfield had laid himself open to suspicion.</p>

<p>"He was killed before eleven," she went on remorselessly, "and you told
me he was in the club with you at that time."</p>

<p>"You don't believe me." He held out his arms to her imploringly, and
then dropped them to his side. "I give you my word that everything I
have told you is true. Why should I lie now?"</p>

<p>She wheeled on him passionately.</p>

<p>"You ask me that?" she said tensely. "You who thought he was in your
way&mdash;that what you could not gain while he was living you might take
when he<!-- Page 38 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span> was dead. Do you think your smooth-faced hypocrisy deceives me
now? You pretended to accept your dismissal, pretended to be still my
friend&mdash;and his."</p>

<p>Her anger disconcerted the man more than her anguish had done. His
breath caught sharply.</p>

<p>"You don't realise what you are saying," he said, speaking calmly with
an effort. "Because I once loved you&mdash;love you still if you will&mdash;before
ever Robert Grell came into your life, you hint an unthinkable thing."</p>

<p>She crossed the room in a graceful swirl of draperies, and laid a finger
on the bell. Her features were set. She was in no state to weigh the
justice or injustice of the implied accusation she had made. And the
man, for his part, felt his oppression brushed away by anger at her
readiness to judge him.</p>

<p>"We shall see whether the police believe it unthinkable," she said
coldly.</p>

<p>A servant tapped discreetly and opened the door.</p>

<p>"Show this person out," she said.</p>

<p>Sir Ralph bowed mechanically. There was nothing more to be said. He knew
that in her present condition an appeal to her to suppress the story of
the telephone message would be worse than useless. As he passed down the
steps and into the street, a man sauntered idly a dozen yards behind
him. And thirty yards behind that man was another whom the baronet might
have recognised as Chief Detective-Inspector Green&mdash;had he seen him.</p>

<p>Within the house a girl, no longer upheld by the strength of passionate
denunciation, had collapsed on a couch, a huddled heap of draperies,
sobbing as though her heart would break.<!-- Page 39 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>


<p>It was an hour after Fairfield had left her before Eileen Meredith's
sobs died away in the deserted room. There was none to hear or see, and
she gave way to her grief uncontrolled. Gradually the first shock
passed. Her calmness came back to her, but she was a different woman to
the vivacious, sunny girl who had looked forward to her wedding-day. Her
face was set stonily, and in the grey depths of her eyes there lurked in
place of laughter an implacable determination.</p>

<p>She had loved Robert Grell with the fierce, passionate devotion of a
strong nature. The sudden news of his death had brought out the
primitive woman bent on vengeance. It was no impulse of suddenly
shattered nerves that had made her turn on Fairfield. To coldly analyse
the facts for and against him was beyond her. She only thought of the
man who had a possible motive for slaying her lover and had had a
possible opportunity.</p>

<p>Yet none would have guessed the burning emotion that thrilled in her
veins as she submitted to the ministrations of her maid. She had not
even troubled to tell her father, although the elderly peer was her only
near relative. Not until he was seated at breakfast did she inform him
in level, passionless tones of what had happened. Even then she said
nothing of her suspicions of Ralph Fairfield. But for her pale face she<!-- Page 40 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
might have been speaking of something in which she was but slightly
interested.</p>

<p>The Duke of Burghley dropped his knife and fork at her first words. As
she finished, he stood over her and passed a hand tenderly around her.</p>

<p>"My poor, poor little girl," he said. "This is terrible. Fairfield ought
to have seen me first. I must telephone for your aunt to come and stay
here until we can get away."</p>

<p>She shook her head a trifle impatiently.</p>

<p>"I don't want her, father. She cannot help me. I would rather be here
alone with you. It would drive me mad to have sympathy showered on me. I
want to see no one. I want to be left to myself."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;my dear, I know it is a shock, but you cannot be allowed to
brood&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She rose abruptly from the table and put him from her.</p>

<p>"I shall not brood," she said. "I shall work. I am going to Scotland
Yard to learn what they know."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, if you wish it," he said soothingly. "We will go at once. I
will order the car now."</p>

<p>"I would rather go alone, if you don't mind," she said decisively, and
the door closed behind her.</p>

<p>"She always was headstrong," remarked the Duke of Burghley to the
devilled kidneys, and stared moodily into the fire.</p>

<p>Since his wife had died he had always been governed by his impetuous,
strong-willed daughter, and accepted the situation philosophically so
long as he had his books and his club. He led a complacent life from
which he was rarely stirred. But he was hit harder than he cared<!-- Page 41 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span> to
admit by the way in which she accepted the tragedy. He wondered vaguely
what he ought to do, and decided to consult Brown&mdash;Brown being the
senior member of his firm of family solicitors.</p>

<p>In his room at Scotland Yard Superintendent Heldon Foyle, a cigar
between his teeth, was studying the book which his staff was compiling.
Already it formed a bulky volume of many hundred typewritten pages. Here
were reports, signed statements, photographs, personal descriptions,
facsimiles of finger-prints, telegrams, letters, surveyors' plans,
notes&mdash;everything, important and unimportant, that might have a possible
bearing on the case. The superintendent turned over the pages with a
moistened forefinger, and made a note now and again on a writing-pad by
his side.</p>

<p>"Puzzling cases are like a jig-saw puzzle," he had once said. "You
juggle about with the facts until you find two or three that fit
together. They give you the key, and you build the rest up round 'em.
But it's no good trying to do it unless you've got your box of pieces
complete."</p>

<p>His box of pieces was not complete, and he knew it. Nevertheless, he
could not resist trying to fit them together. But the announcement made
by his clerk of the arrival of Lady Eileen Meredith came while he was
still puzzling. She stood in the doorway, a dainty figure in furs, a
heavy veil drawn over her face.</p>

<p>"Mr. Foyle?" she asked hesitatingly.</p>

<p>He bowed and wheeled a big arm-chair near his desk.</p>

<p>"Yes. Won't you sit down, Lady Eileen? You have just missed one of our
men. I sent him round to break the news to you. I need not tell you that
we<!-- Page 42 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span> recognise how you must feel in these terrible circumstances. We
shall trouble you as little as possible after you have answered a few
questions."</p>

<p>He was studying her shrewdly while he spoke, and her strange composure
struck him at once. Even to her he had decided to say nothing of the
identity of the murdered man. That could wait until he had had a better
opportunity to judge her.</p>

<p>She sat down and rested her chin on one slim, gloved hand, her elbow on
the desk.</p>

<p>"That's very good of you," she said formally. And then broke direct into
her mission. "Have you found out anything, Mr. Foyle?"</p>

<p>"It's rather early to say anything yet," he hedged. "Our inquiries are
not completed."</p>

<p>"There is no need for further inquiry. I can tell you who the murderer
is."</p>

<p>Superintendent Foyle coughed and idly shifted a piece of paper over the
notes on his blotting-pad. His face was inscrutable. She could not tell
whether her statement had startled him or not. For all the change in his
expression she might have merely remarked that the weather was fine. Had
it been any one else he would have said that before the day was out he
expected a dozen or more people to tell him that they knew the
murderer&mdash;and that in each case the selection would be different. As it
was he merely said with polite interest&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ah, that will save us a great deal of trouble. Who is it?"</p>

<p>"He is&mdash;I believe him to be Sir Ralph Fairfield."</p>

<p>The superintendent's eyelids flickered curiously;<!-- Page 43 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span> otherwise he gave no
sign of the quickening of his interest. He was a judge of men, and
although Fairfield had rebuffed him he did not believe him to be a
murderer. Still, one never knew. Those who kill are not cast in one
mould. If Sir Ralph had slain Goldenburg in mistake for Grell, and Lady
Eileen knew there must be a motive&mdash;for that motive he had to look no
further than the beautiful, unsmiling face before him.</p>

<p>"You realise that you are making a very grave accusation, Lady Eileen?"
he said. "What reason should there be?"</p>

<p>She spoke rapidly, steadily, and he did not interrupt her. His pen
rushed swiftly across the paper, taking down her words. They would
presently be neatly typed and added to the book. When she paused, he
replaced the pen tidily in its rack.</p>

<p>"This is what it comes to&mdash;that at eleven o'clock Sir Ralph said Mr.
Grell was with him. You say that you had refused an offer of marriage
from Sir Ralph, and think that he murdered Mr. Grell from jealousy. I
may say that, though we know Sir Ralph was at his club for dinner and at
eleven o'clock, we can find neither servants nor members who can say for
certain that he was there at the time the murder was committed."</p>

<p>She caught her breath. "Then it was he!" she exclaimed eagerly. "Bob had
not another enemy in the world. You will arrest him."</p>

<p>"Not yet," Foyle retorted, and noted that her face fell. "All this is
only suspicion. We must have proof to satisfy a jury before we can do
anything with a man<!-- Page 44 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span> in Sir Ralph's position. And now, if you don't
mind, I should like to put a few other questions to you."</p>

<p>When she left after half an hour, Foyle threw back his head with a jerk.</p>

<p>"A pleasant girl," he commented. "Seems wonderfully anxious to have
Fairfield hanged. I suppose she was really infatuated with Grell. You
never know how women are going to take things. I wonder if I can get a
set of his finger-prints. That ought to settle the matter one way or the
other, so far as he is concerned. But it won't clear up what Goldenburg
was doing in Grell's place. I'll have to fix that somehow."<!-- Page 45 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX</h2>


<p>The overmastering energy of Heldon Foyle was at once the envy and
despair of his subordinates. There was a story that once he went without
sleep for a week while unravelling the mystery of the robbery of the
Countess of Enver's pearls. That was probably exaggerated, but he
certainly spent no unnecessary time for rest or food when work was
toward&mdash;and he saw also that his staff were urged to the limits of human
endurance.</p>

<p>Having spent four hours sleeping in his clothes, he deemed that he had
paid full courtesy to nature. He unlocked a drawer, picked out a deadly
little automatic pistol, and dropped it into his jacket pocket. He
rarely went armed, and had never fired a shot in his life save at a
target. But on certain occasions a pistol was useful to "back a bluff."
And on the mission he had in mind he might need something. He felt in
his breast-pocket to make certain that the enlarged photograph of the
finger-prints found on the dagger were there, and sallied forth into the
dusk.</p>

<p>In his own mind he had definitely decided on the immediately important
points in the inquiry. There was Ivan, the missing servant, to be found,
as also the Princess Petrovska. The police of a dozen countries were
keeping a look-out for them. Then there was the knife with its quaint,
horizontal hilt of ivory. Rigorous inquiry had failed to elicit its
place of origin, yet so strange a weapon once seen would infallibly be<!-- Page 46 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
recognised again. Finally, there was the question of Sir Ralph
Fairfield.</p>

<p>The evening papers had seized avidly on a mystery after their own heart,
and glaring contents-bills told of "Millionaire Murdered on Wedding Eve.
Strange Mystery." But Foyle had already seen the papers. He held
straight on for the Albany.</p>

<p>"Was Sir Ralph Fairfield in?" The question was superfluous, for he had
already seen Chief Detective-Inspector Green standing outside apparently
much interested in an evening paper. And Green would not have been there
unless Sir Ralph were about.</p>

<p>Foyle was received coldly by the baronet, and his quick eyes noted a
half-empty decanter on the table. Fairfield was palpably nervous and ill
at ease. He was plainly distrustful of his visitor's purpose. The
detective was apologetic and good-humoured.</p>

<p>"I have come to apologise for my rudeness at Grosvenor Gardens," he
began. "I was worried, and you were, of course, upset. Now we are both
more calm, I come to ask you if you would like to add anything to what
you said. Of course, you'll be called to give evidence at the inquest,
and it would make it easier for you as well as for us if we knew what
you were going to say."</p>

<p>Fairfield shrugged his shoulders. "I have told you all you will learn
from me," he said quickly. "I suppose you've seen Lady Eileen Meredith."</p>

<p>"No." The lie was prompt, but the superintendent salved his conscience
with the thought that it was a necessary one. "I don't know that she can
tell us anything of value."<!-- Page 47 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>

<p>An expression of relief flitted over the face of Grell's friend. After
all, it was something to have the worst postponed. A man may face swift
danger with debonair courage, may be undaunted by perils or emergencies
of sport, of travel, of everyday life. But few innocent men can believe
that a net is slowly closing round them which will end in the obloquy of
the Central Criminal Court, or in a shameful death, without feeling
something of the terror of the hunted. "The terror of the law" is very
real in such cases. Fairfield was no coward, but his nerves had begun to
go under the strain of the suspense. It would have been different had he
been able to do anything&mdash;to find relief in action. But he had to remain
passively impotent.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, "I expect you're very busy, Mr. Foyle. I don't want to
keep you."</p>

<p>The detective received the snub with an amiable smile. "I won't force my
company on you, Sir Ralph. If you will just dictate to me a description
of the string of pearls that Grell showed you, I will go. Can you let me
have a pen and some paper?"</p>

<p>Ungraciously enough Fairfield flung open a small inlaid writing-desk,
and Foyle took down the description as though he really needed it. As he
finished he held out the pen to Fairfield.</p>

<p>"Will you sign that, please? No, here."</p>

<p>Their hands were almost touching. Foyle half rose and stumbled clumsily,
clutching the other's wrist to save himself. The baronet's hand and
fingers were pressed down heavily on the still wet writing. The
detective recovered his balance and apologised profusely, at the same
time picking up the sheet of paper.<!-- Page 48 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't know how I came to do that. I am very sorry. It's smudged the
paper a bit, but that won't matter. It's still readable. Good-bye, Sir
Ralph."</p>

<p>So admirably had the accident been contrived that even Fairfield never
suspected that it was anything but genuine. In a public telephone-box, a
few hundred yards away, Heldon Foyle was examining the half-sheet of
notepaper side by side with the photograph of the finger-prints on the
dagger. A telephone-box is admirably constructed for the private
examination of documents if one's back is towards the door and one is
bent over the directory. Line by line Foyle traced "laterals," "lakes,"
and "accidentals," calling to his aid a magnifying glass from his
waistcoat pocket.</p>

<p>When he emerged he was rubbing his chin vigorously. The prints were
totally different. Sir Ralph Fairfield was not the murderer of the man
so astoundingly like Robert Grell.<!-- Page 49 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X</h2>


<p>The evidence of the finger-prints was entirely negative. Though Foyle
believed that Fairfield was innocent, he never permitted himself to be
swayed by his opinions into neglecting a possibility. It was still
possible that the baronet might have been concerned in the crime even
though they were some one else's prints on the dagger. At any rate
Fairfield was suppressing something. It could do no harm to continue the
watch that had been set upon him. So Foyle left Green and his companion
to continue their unobtrusive vigil.</p>

<p>To justify his stay in the box&mdash;for he was artist enough to do things
thoroughly even though it might be unnecessary&mdash;he lifted the receiver
and put a call through to Scotland Yard.</p>

<p>"This is Foyle speaking," he said when at last he had got the man he
asked for. "Is there anything fresh for me?"</p>

<p>"Nothing important, sir, except that Blake has found a curiosity dealer
who says that the knife is one that must have come from South America.
It is, he says, an unusual sort of Mexican dagger."</p>

<p>"Oh. Is the man who says that to be relied on? He isn't just guessing?
We can do all the guessing we want ourselves."</p>

<p>"No, sir, we think he's all right. It's Marfield&mdash;one of the biggest men
in the trade. By the way, sir, there's a lot of newspaper men been
asking for you<!-- Page 50 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span> since you left. They want to know about Goldenburg."</p>

<p>"So do I," retorted the other. "You'd better be strictly truthful with
'em, Mainland. Tell 'em you know no more than is on the reward bill.
They won't believe you, anyway. You can say I've gone home to bed, and
that there will be nothing more doing this evening. Good-bye."</p>

<p>"A Mexican dagger," he muttered to himself as he left the telephone-box.
"Now, if I were a story-book detective I should assume that the murderer
was either a South American or had travelled in South America. It looked
the kind of thing a woman might carry in her garter. And a veiled woman
called on him that night"&mdash;he made a wry face. "Foyle, my lad, you're
assuming things. That way madness lies. The dagger might have been
bought anywhere as a curiosity, and the veiled woman may have been a
purely innocent caller."</p>

<p>His meditations had brought him to a great restaurant off the Strand. He
passed through the swing doors into the lavishly gilded dining-room, and
selected a table somewhere near the centre. With the air of a man taking
his ease after a strenuous day in the City, he ordered his dinner
carefully, seeking the waiter's advice now and again. Then his eye roved
carelessly over the throng of diners while he waited for his orders to
be fulfilled. The apparently casual scrutiny lasted rather less than a
minute. Then he shifted his seat so that he could see without effort the
table where two men lingered over their liqueurs. A moment later one of
the men noted the solitary figure of the detective.<!-- Page 51 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>

<p>He emptied his glass without haste and signalled to the waiter. Before
that functionary had made out the bill Foyle had strolled over to the
table, his face beaming, his hand outstretched.</p>

<p>"How are you, Eden?" he cried effusively. "Who'd have thought of seeing
you here! Business good? Still picking flowers?"</p>

<p>An expression of annoyance crossed the face of the slighter built of the
two men, yet he shook hands readily.</p>

<p>"Why, it's Mr. Foyle!" he exclaimed heartily. "How are you? We were just
going. Let me introduce Mr. Maxwell."</p>

<p>They called him the Garden of Eden at Scotland Yard&mdash;probably because
the unwary might have thought him full of innocence. His smooth, bronzed
boyish face showed ingenuousness and candour in every line. A glittering
diamond pin adorned his necktie, a massive gold chain spanned his
waistcoat, a gold ring with a single great ruby was on his finger. That
was the only ostentation about him, and his quiet, well-cut clothes were
in good taste.</p>

<p>Foyle acknowledged the introduction.</p>

<p>"From the colonies, I suppose, Mr. Maxwell? I suppose Eden has told you
he's just come over." Eden surveyed the detective with wide-open,
innocent blue eyes in which there dwelt hurt reproach. "I hate to
separate you, but I've got important business with him. Perhaps you'll
meet another time."</p>

<p>"Yes, you'll excuse me now, old man," chimed in Eden blandly. "Call for
me at the Palatial at eleven to-morrow, and we'll make a day of it."</p>

<p>Maxwell had no sooner accepted his dismissal than<!-- Page 52 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span> Foyle led the other
over to his table. Eden walked with the manner of one uncertain what was
about to happen.</p>

<p>"It is all right, Mr. Foyle," he protested eagerly. "It is <i>all right</i>.
I haven't touched him for a sou."</p>

<p>Foyle began on the soup placidly.</p>

<p>"You're a joker, Jimmy," he smiled. "Don't get uneasy. I'm not going to
carry you inside. Only you'll have to leave the Palatial to-night,
Jimmy&mdash;to-night, do you understand? And if Maxwell turns up with a
complaint against you there'll be pretty bad trouble. You'll be put out
of temptation for good and all. There's such a thing as preventive
detention in this country now, you know."</p>

<p>The Garden of Eden looked pained.</p>

<p>"Truth, Mr. Foyle, I haven't done a thing," he declared earnestly. "I'm
trying the straight game now."</p>

<p>Heldon Foyle wagged his head.</p>

<p>"And staying at the Palatial," he smiled. "Oh, Jimmy, Jimmy! I believe
you, of course." And he went on with his soup.</p>

<p>Suddenly he looked up. "When did you last see Goldenburg?" he demanded
curtly. "No nonsense, mind, Jimmy."</p>

<p>Eden's face had cleared. "So that's the lay, is it?" he said with
relief. "I saw the bills out for him, and I don't mind helping you if I
can, Mr. Foyle. He was never what you'd call a proper pal, and I don't
bear any malice, though you've just done me out of a cool five hundred.
That mug who's just gone"&mdash;he jerked his head towards the door&mdash;"was
going to follow my tip and back a horse that won't win to-morrow. That's
a bit hard, isn't it, Mr. Foyle?"<!-- Page 53 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>

<p>From his breast-pocket Foyle took a ten-pound note and slid it across
the table. He followed Eden's meaning.</p>

<p>"Cough it up," he advised.</p>

<p>The Garden of Eden took the note and thrust it into his trousers pocket.</p>

<p>"He was in Victoria Station, talking to a foreign-looking chap, on
Wednesday night." A look of astonishment crossed his face while he
spoke. "By the living jingo, there's the very man he was talking to
coming in now."</p>

<p>Foyle folded his serviette neatly and rose.</p>

<p>"Right, Jimmy. I'll talk to you later. Go to the Yard and wait till I
come," he said, and, walking swiftly across the room, thrust his arm
through that of the new arrival.</p>

<p>"You are the man who used to be Mr. Grell's valet," he said quietly in
French. "I am a police officer, and you must come with me."<!-- Page 54 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI"></a>CHAPTER XI</h2>


<p>The man tried to jerk himself free, but the detective's fingers closed
tightly about his wrist.</p>

<p>"There is no use making a scene, my man," he said, still speaking in
French, his voice stern, but pitched in a low key. "You are Ivan
something-or-other, and you know of the murder of your master. So come
along."</p>

<p>"It's a mistake," protested the other volubly in the same language. His
words slurred into each other in his excitement. "I am not the man you
take me for. I am Pierre Bazarre, a jeweller of Paris, and I have my
credentials. I will not submit to this abominable outrage. I know
nothing of M. Grell; you shall not arrest me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Heldon Foyle cut him short. He had, without the appearance of force,
quietly forced his prisoner outside the restaurant and signalled to a
passing taxicab.</p>

<p>"I am not arresting you," he said, ignoring the protestations of the
other. "I am going to detain you till you give a satisfactory
explanation of your reason for leaving Mr. Grell's house on the night of
the murder."</p>

<p>They were on the edge of the pavement close to the cab. Ivan with a
quick oath wheeled inward, and struck savagely at the superintendent's
face. Foyle's grip did not relax. He merely lowered his head, seemingly
without haste, and, as the man swung forward with the<!-- Page 55 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span> momentum of the
blow, jabbed with his own free hand at his body. So neatly was it done
that passers-by saw nothing but an apparently drunken man collapse on
the pavement in spite of the endeavours of his friend to hold him up.</p>

<p>The whole breath had been knocked out of Ivan's body by those two swift
body-blows. Before he could recover, Foyle had lifted him bodily into
the cab.</p>

<p>"King Street," he said quietly to the driver, and sat down opposite to
Ivan, alert and watchful.</p>

<p>"Sorry if I hurt you," he apologised. "It will be all right in a minute.
It has only upset your wind a little. That will pass off."</p>

<p>Ivan, his hands pressed tightly to the pit of his stomach, groaned.
Presently he straightened himself up, and Foyle, calmly ignoring the
assault, produced a cigar-case.</p>

<p>"Have a cigar? I've no doubt you'll be able to make things all right
when we get to the station. There's nothing to worry about. You will
just have a little talk with me, and as soon as one or two points are
cleared up you'll be able to go."</p>

<p>The case was struck angrily aside. Foyle smiled, and although his whole
body was taut in anticipation of any fresh attempt at violence, he
quietly struck a match and lit one himself.</p>

<p>"As you like," he said imperturbably. "They're good cigars. I have them
sent over to me by a friend direct from Havana."</p>

<p>All the while he was speaking he was scrutinising the man who had been
Grell's valet with deliberate care. Ivan was sleek and well-groomed,
with a dark<!-- Page 56 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span> face and prominent cheekbones that betrayed his Caucasian
origin. The brows were drawn tightly in a surly frown; a heavy dark
moustache hid the upper lip, and though the shoulders were sloping he
was obviously a man of considerable physical strength.</p>

<p>Foyle felt that it was going to be no easy matter to win this man's
confidence. Yet he was determined to do so. Beyond the fact that he had
vanished when the murder was discovered, there was nothing so far to
suggest that he was the actual culprit. Certain it was, however, that he
must have knowledge of matters which would prove valuable. If he would
volunteer the information, well and good. The detective did not wish to
have to question him, for such a course, however advisable it might
appear, could be made to assume an ugly look in the hands of the astute
counsel, should the man be charged with the crime. Where by French or
American methods a statement might have been extracted by bullying or by
cross-examination, here it had to be extracted by diplomacy if possible.</p>

<p>Sullen and silent, Ivan alighted from the cab as it drew up under the
blue lamp outside King Street police station. He passed arm-in-arm with
Foyle up the steps. With a nod to the uniformed inspector in the outer
office, the superintendent led him into the offices set apart for the
divisional detachment of the Criminal Investigation Department. A
broad-shouldered man with side whiskers, who was writing at a desk,
looked up as they entered.</p>

<p>"Good morning, Mr. Norman," said Foyle. "This gentleman wants to tell me
something about the Grell case. Just give him a chair, will you, and
send in a<!-- Page 57 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span> shorthand writer who understands French to take a statement."</p>

<p>"I shall make no statement," broke in the Russian angrily, speaking in
French, but with a readiness that showed he was able to follow English.
"It's all a mistake&mdash;a mistake for which you will pay heavily."</p>

<p>"Ah! that's just what I wish to get at. There seems to be a little
confusion. Perhaps I have been over-zealous, but the fact is,
Monsieur&mdash;er&mdash;Bazarre, you are wearing a false moustache, and that
rather aroused my suspicions&mdash;see?"</p>

<p>His hand did not seem to move, yet a second later the heavy moustache
had been torn from the man's face. He started to his feet with an
exclamation. Foyle waved him back to his chair.</p>

<p>"I only wanted to feel sure that I was right. Now, monsieur, I want to
make it clear that I have no right to ask you anything. If you wish to
say anything, it will be taken down, and what action I take depends on
what you say."</p>

<p>Ivan scowled into the fire and preserved a stubborn silence. Whether he
knew it or not, he held all the advantage. Unless he committed himself
by some incautious word, there was little to implicate him in the
murder. Suspicion there might be, but legal proof there was none. It
would scarcely do to arrest him on such flimsy evidence. The Russian
police had failed to trace his antecedents, and the Criminal
Investigation Department were ignorant even of his surname. He had been
known simply as Ivan at Grosvenor Gardens.</p>

<p>Foyle tried again, and this time his voice was silky and soft as ever as
he uttered a plainer threat.<!-- Page 58 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span></p>

<p>"I want to help you if I can. I don't want to have to charge you with
the murder of Mr. Grell."</p>

<p>The warm blood surged crimson to Ivan's face. In an instant he was out
of his chair and had leapt at the throat of the detective. So rapid, so
unexpected was the movement that, although Heldon Foyle had not ceased
his careful watchfulness, and although he writhed quickly aside, he was
borne back by his assailant. The two crashed heavily to the floor. As
they rolled over, struggling desperately, the grip upon the detective's
throat grew ever tighter and tighter.</p>

<p>Half a dozen men had rushed into the room at the noise of the struggle,
and strove vainly to tear the Russian from his hold. But he hung on with
the tenacity of a mastiff. There was a ringing in Foyle's ear and a red
blur before his eyes. With a superhuman effort he got his elbow under
the Russian's chin and pressed it back sharply.</p>

<p>The grip relaxed ever so slightly, but it was enough. Instantly Foyle
had wrested himself free, and Ivan was pinioned to the floor by the
others.</p>

<p>"Handcuffs," said the superintendent sharply.</p>

<p>Some one got a pair on the prisoner's wrists, and he was jerked none too
gently to his feet. A couple of men still held him. At a word from Foyle
the others had gone about their business, with the exception of Norman.
The superintendent flicked the dust from his clothes, and picked
something, which had fallen during the struggle, from the floor.</p>

<p>"You admit you are Ivan, then?" he said quietly.</p>

<p>The Russian showed his teeth in a beast-like snarl.</p>

<p>"Yes, I am Ivan," he said. "Make what you can<!-- Page 59 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span> of that, but you cannot
have me hanged for the murder of Mr. Grell&mdash;<i>and you know why</i>."</p>

<p>"Because Mr. Grell is not dead," retorted the detective smoothly. "Yes,
I know that."</p>

<p>He counted the rough-and-tumble but little against the fact that the
Russian had now admitted that he knew it was not Grell's body that had
been found in the study. Here was a starting-point at last.</p>

<p>"What I want now," he went on slowly, "is an explanation of how you came
to have possession of these."</p>

<p>He held up the thing he had picked from the floor. It was a case of blue
Morocco leather, and as he opened it a magnificent string of pearls
showed startlingly white against a dark background.</p>

<p>"These pearls were bought at Streeters' by Mr. Grell as a wedding
present to Lady Eileen Meredith," he said. "How do they come in your
possession?"</p>

<p>"They were given to me by Mr. Grell," cried Ivan. The fierce passion
that had made him attack Foyle on the hint of arrest seemed to have
melted away.</p>

<p>Heldon Foyle's mask of a face showed no sign of the incredulity he felt.
He made no comment, but ran his hands swiftly through the Russian's
pockets, piling money, keys, watch, and other articles in a little heap
on the table. Beyond a single letter there were no documents on the man.
He scanned the missive quickly. It was an ordinary commonplace note from
a jeweller in Paris, addressed to Ivan Abramovitch. This he placed
aside.</p>

<p>"May as well have his finger-prints," he said, and one of the officers
present pressed Ivan's hands on a<!-- Page 60 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span> piece of inky tin, and then on a
piece of paper. The superintendent glanced casually at the impression.</p>

<p>"All right," he said. "Take those handcuffs off. You may go, Mr.
Abramovitch."</p>

<p>The Russian stood motionless, as though not understanding. Foyle wheeled
about as though the whole matter had been dismissed from his mind, and
caught Norman by the sleeve.</p>

<p>"Drop everything," he said in a curt whisper. "Take a couple of men and
don't let that man out of your sight for an instant. I'll have you
relieved from the Yard in an hour's time."</p>

<p>"Aren't you going to charge him, sir?" asked the other in astonishment.</p>

<p>"Not likely," said Foyle, with a laugh.<!-- Page 61 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII"></a>CHAPTER XII</h2>


<p>Heldon Foyle walked thoughtfully back to Scotland Yard, satisfied that
the shadowing of Ivan Abramovitch was in competent hands. With the
strong man's confidence in himself, he had no fears as to his decision
to release the man. He was beginning to have a shadowy idea of the
relation of pieces in his jig-saw puzzle. Ivan, he knew, ought to have
been arrested if only for failing to give a satisfactory account of his
possession of the pearl necklace. But the superintendent had, as he
mentally phrased it, "tied a string to him," and it would not be his
fault if nothing resulted.</p>

<p>It was well after midnight before he had finished his work at Scotland
Yard. He had had a long interview with the Garden of Eden, in which
promises were adroitly mingled with threats. In the result the
"bunco-steerer" had promised to keep his eyes and ears alert for news of
any one resembling Goldenburg. There was a string of other callers who
had been discreetly sorted out by the superintendent's diplomatic
lieutenants. Finally, he pulled out the book which dealt with the case,
and with the aid of a typist added several more chapters. With a sigh of
relief, he at last sauntered out into the cool, fresh midnight air.</p>

<p>Nine o'clock next morning saw him again in his office. Sir Hilary
Thornton was his first caller. Foyle put aside his reports at his
chief's opening question.</p>

<p>"Yes, we've taken every human precaution to pre<!-- Page 62 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>serve secrecy," he
replied. "Every one who knows that it is not Grell's body in the house
has been pledged to hold his tongue. I have managed to get the inquest
put back for three days, so that there will be no evidence of
identification till then. That gives us a chance. And I've made out a
confidential report to be sent to the Foreign Office, so that Grell's
Government shan't get restive. Here are the latest reports, sir."</p>

<p>The Assistant Commissioner bent over the sheaf of typewritten documents
for a little in complete absorption. As he came to the last sheet he
gave a start of surprise.</p>

<p>"So you let this man Ivan go? Do you think that wise?"</p>

<p>"I'm fishing," answered Foyle enigmatically. "I couldn't have better
bait than Ivan. There are three men sticking to him like limpets now,
and a couple are keeping an eye on Sir Ralph Fairfield. I think that
will be all right. Do you remember the Mighton Grange case? We knew
there had been a murder, but couldn't do anything till we found the
body. Dutful, the murderer, would have slid off to some place where
there's no extradition, but for the fact that I had him arrested on a
charge of being in the unlawful possession of a pickaxe handle. This
affair is the converse of that. We can't afford to have Ivan under lock
and key."</p>

<p>Sir Hilary Thornton bit his lip and looked steadfastly at the scarlet
geranium on the window-sill, as though in search of enlightenment.</p>

<p>"I believe I see," he exclaimed after a pause. "Ivan must have been
something more than a valet. He's a<!-- Page 63 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span> superior type of man, and the
conclusion to be drawn if he knows that Grell is alive&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Precisely," interrupted the superintendent.</p>

<p>"Any result from the offer of a reward for Goldenburg?"</p>

<p>A flicker of amusement dwelt in Heldon Foyle's blue eyes. "Yes. He has
been seen by different people within an hour or two of each other in
Glasgow, Southampton, Gloucester, Cherbourg, Plymouth, and Cardiff. Our
information on that point is not precisely helpful. Of course, we've got
the local police making inquiries in each case, but I don't anticipate
they will find out much. Still, it will keep 'em amused."</p>

<p>The necessity of a conference broke up further conversation. Gathered in
the building were some thirty or forty departmental chiefs of the
C.I.D., the picked men of their profession. Most of them were divisional
detective inspectors who were in charge of districts, and some few were
men who had special duties. They were ranged about tables in a lofty
room, its green distempered walls hung with stiff photographs of living
and retired officials. Men of all types were there, from the spruce,
smartly groomed detectives of the West End to the burly, ill-dressed
detectives of the East. Between them they spoke every known language.
Here was Penny, who had specialised in forgeries; Brown, who knew every
trick of coiners; Malby, the terror of race-course sharps; Menzies, who
had as keen a scent for the gambling hell as a hound for a fox; Poole,
who was intimate with the ways of railway thieves and shoplifters. Not
one but thoroughly understood his profession, and knew where to look for
his information.<!-- Page 64 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p>

<p>Foyle took the chair, and the buzz of conversation became general. It
was a business conference of experts. Views were exchanged on concrete
problems; the movements of well-known criminals discussed.
"Velvet-fingered Ned" had disappeared from Islington and reappeared in
Brixton. "Tony" Smith was due out of prison. Mike O'Brien had patched up
the peace with "Yid" Foster, and when they got together&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>So the talk went on, and so every district learned what was taking place
in other districts. The superintendent sat silent for a while,
listening. At last his smooth voice broke in.</p>

<p>"The man Ivan, whose description was circulated, is not to be touched
now. Tell your men to let him alone if they come across him."</p>

<p>There was a deep chorus, "Very good, sir," and Foyle, with a nod of
dismissal, left the room. He stopped to make an inquiry in the clerk's
office, and passing along the corridor unlocked a door and pressed a
bell.</p>

<p>In under half an hour a big labourer, with corduroys tied about the
knees, lurched unsteadily out of the Lost Property Office and passed
into Whitehall. Rough, tousled hair, an unkempt moustache, and a day's
growth of beard on the chin were details warranted to stand inspection.
Heldon Foyle rarely used a disguise, but when he did he was careful that
nothing should get out of order. Hair and moustache were his own, dyed
and brushed cunningly. Yet, when he reeled against Green near the
Albany, the inspector, who was an observant man, pushed him roughly
aside with an anathema on his clumsiness.<!-- Page 65 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>

<p>"Didn't 'urt you, did it?" stormed the labourer aggressively. "'Course I
look where I'm going." Then in a lower tone: "I'm Foyle. I got your
telephone message. Anything moving now?"</p>

<p>"If you don't go away I shall call a constable." Green had been quick to
see his cue and spoke loudly. He went on rapidly. "He hasn't stirred
out. A post-office messenger has just gone in with a letter for him. I
said I was expecting one, and got a glimpse at it."</p>

<p>"All right, old pal. Don't get excited. You go home and tell the missus
all about it," retorted the labourer.</p>

<p>Green walked rapidly away, spoke a few words to a man who was standing
on the other side of the road, deeply interested in a bookseller's
window, and departed.</p>

<p>The superintendent felt in his pockets and produced a couple of boxes of
matches. A constable strolled up, dignified and stern. A swift word in
an undertone sent him away with burning cheeks.</p>

<p>In half an hour Foyle had sold a box of matches, for which he received
sixpence with profuse thanks and inward disgust. If he sold his second
box and still hung about, his loitering without excuse might attract
undesirable attention. The contingency, however, did not arise, for a
minute or two later Fairfield himself strolled into the street. Foyle
rushed to open the door of a taxicab, which he hailed, but another tout
was before him. Nevertheless, he heard the address.</p>

<p>"Grave Street, Whitechapel," he murmured to himself, as the cab slipped
away. "Ivan has got to work."</p>

<p>A short argument with a second cab-driver, who dis<!-- Page 66 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>trusted his
appearance, was cut short by a deposit of five shillings as a guarantee
of good faith, and the superintendent also began the journey. Behind him
a third cab carried the man who had been so deeply interested in the
bookseller's window.<!-- Page 67 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII"></a>CHAPTER XIII</h2>


<p>Grave Street, Whitechapel, is not a savoury neighbourhood. One may pass
from end to end of its squalid length and hear scarce a word of English.
Yiddish is the language most favoured by its cosmopolitan population,
although one may hear now and again Polish, Russian, or German. In its
barrack-like houses, rising sheer from the pavement, a chain of tenancy
obtains, ranging from the actual householder to the tenant of half a
room, who sublets corners of the meagre space on terms payable strictly
in advance. A score of people will herd together in a room a few feet
square, and never realise that they are cramped for space.</p>

<p>Here you will find petty thieves, versatile rascals ripe for any
mischief, and sweated factory workers; here sallow-faced anarchists
boldly denounce the existing order of things to their fellows and scheme
the millennium. Slatternly women quarrel at the doors, and horse-flesh
is a staple article of diet.</p>

<p>The neatly dressed Fairfield descending at the end of the street from
his taxicab was as conspicuous among the unshaven idlers who hung about
the pavements as the moon among the stars.</p>

<p>Sir Ralph picked his way towards a newspaper shop, his mind full of the
message that had brought him to the spot. The letter delivered by the
messenger had contained but a few words in printed characters.<!-- Page 68 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>

<blockquote><p>"If you would learn the truth about the murder in Grosvenor
Gardens, come immediately to No. &mdash; Grave Street."</p></blockquote>

<p>There was no signature, no clue to the identity of the writer. Fairfield
had leapt at the chance to do something. Even if it were a hoax it would
occupy his mind for a time, and take his thoughts away from the sinister
shadow that overhung him. Somehow, however, he did not think it was a
hoax.</p>

<p>The newspaper shop displayed the number given in the note on its grimy
facia. The baronet, as he moved towards it, was unconscious of the
slouching figure of the labourer, who had been selling matches near the
Albany, a few paces behind him. His foot was on the threshold of the
shop when a man, black-bearded and swarthy, pressed an envelope into his
hand.</p>

<p>Foyle watched the incident and his pace quickened. Before Fairfield had
time to do more than glance at the inscription of the envelope he was
abreast. He lurched inward and his fingers snatched quickly at the note.
The next instant he was running with long, even strides for the open of
the main road.</p>

<p>It was barefaced robbery, of course, but he had not the inclination to
stick at trifles. That the note had some bearing on the case he was
investigating he felt certain. There was only one way to get it at once,
and that was to steal. Anywhere else but in Grave Street he would have
waited to face the matter out. Not that Grave Street would have frowned
upon a theft, but that he would have been forced to reveal his
identity,<!-- Page 69 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span> and Grave Street was not a healthy neighbourhood for solitary
detectives.</p>

<p>Sir Ralph stood thunderstruck, but some one else acted. The
black-bearded man had disappeared. From somewhere there were a couple of
dull thuds like a hammer falling upon wood, and Foyle heard the whistle
of bullets over his head.</p>

<p>"I'll get even for that," he muttered between his teeth, but his
headlong flight never slackened.</p>

<p>Behind him was a clatter of pursuing feet. Fairfield, recovering
himself, had raised a cry and it was taken up.</p>

<p>"Stop thief! Hold him!"</p>

<p>He passed the man who had been so eagerly intent on the bookshop. The
man made a clutch at him, missed and fell headlong right in the path of
Fairfield, now a few paces behind. The baronet tripped over his body and
was thrown violently to the ground.</p>

<p>Foyle made a mental note in favour of Detective-Sergeant Chambers, who
had so adroitly intercepted the pursuit. As he came to the main road he
slackened his pace to a sharp walk, and dived into an underground
station. He breathed a sigh of relief as he passed down the steps to the
platform.</p>

<p>He had anticipated trouble, but pistol-shots in broad daylight, even in
Grave Street, had been outside his calculations. He had recognised the
peculiar report of an automatic pistol. His adversaries, whoever they
might be, were obviously very much in earnest. Pistol-shooting at
detectives is not a commonplace pastime even with the most reckless of
criminals. Foyle decided on another and early visit to Grave Street, and
prom<!-- Page 70 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>ised himself grimly that the target should be some one else, if it
came to shooting again. He was in danger of losing his temper.</p>

<p>Not until he had got in the train did he open the note that was still
between his fingers. He frowned as he read it.</p>

<p>"Curse it! This comes of acting on impulse. Why couldn't I have waited!
I had the whole thing in my hands."</p>

<p>The note said simply&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"I am alive. I must see you. Follow the man who gives you this
note.&mdash;R.&nbsp;G."</p></blockquote>

<p>Heldon Foyle had seen much of Robert Grell's writing during his search
of the house in Grosvenor Gardens, and had no doubt that the note was
his. His peace of mind was not increased by the reflection that had he
waited and continued to shadow Fairfield he might have discovered the
whereabouts of the missing diplomat. Now he had merely given notice as
plainly as though he had shouted from the housetops that Fairfield was
under observation. He had committed a blunder, and he did not forgive
blunders easily, especially in himself.</p>

<p>Even a bath and a change into his normal clothing did not restore his
equanimity. In his office he found Green, with a strange excitement in
his usually stolid face.</p>

<p>"Hello, Mr. Green. What's wrong?" he demanded.</p>

<p>The veteran chief detective-inspector pulled at his moustache.<!-- Page 71 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't know, sir, yet. You've come just in time. Waverley is missing.</p>

<p>"Waverley missing! That's nonsense. He was put on to relieve Norman in
shadowing Ivan Abramovitch."</p>

<p>"He's missing," repeated the other doggedly. "Ivan went into a shop with
an entrance in two streets, and the man who was assisting Waverley
slipped round to the other side. He waited there an hour, and then went
to look for Waverley."</p>

<p>The superintendent gave a short, contemptuous laugh.</p>

<p>"Green, I guess you've been working too hard lately. You ought to apply
for a fortnight's leave. Can't you see, Ivan came out and that Waverley
never had time to give the tip to his man, but followed him straight
away? There ought to have been three men on the job."</p>

<p>Green drew himself up stiffly. Foyle had not recovered from the
irritation caused by his own mistake, otherwise he would not have spoken
as he did. Green was not the kind of man to hastily jump to conclusions.</p>

<p>"A third was not available when Waverley left," he said. "Here is why I
say Waverley is missing. It came by messenger five minutes ago,
addressed to you. As senior officer I opened it."</p>

<p>Foyle took a typewritten sheet of paper from the other's hand. It read
simply&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Foyle</span>,&mdash;You had better call your men off. We have got one
of them safe, and hold him as a hostage for our own safety. If your
people go on trying to make things unpleasant for us, things will
get<!-- Page 72 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span> unpleasant for him. This is not melodrama, but brutal fact."</p></blockquote>

<p>There was no signature. Foyle's square jaw became set and grim. He had
no doubt that the unknown writer fully meant the threat. He liked
Waverley, yet the thought of the other's peril did not sway him for a
moment. The man had fallen a victim to one of the risks of his
profession.</p>

<p>"Do they expect us to back down?" asked the superintendent harshly. "If
Waverley has been fool enough to get himself in a fix, he must take his
chance if we can't get him out. Let's have a look at this paper."</p>

<p>He thrust his hand in a drawer, and, flinging a pinch of black powder on
the letter, sifted it gingerly to and fro. In a few seconds four
finger-prints stared out blackly from the white surface. They were at
right angles to the type, and just beneath it. Foyle's face relaxed in a
pleased smile.</p>

<p>"They've given us something that may help us, after all, Green," he
cried. "Look here; these two middle ones are the prints on the dagger.
Now let's see if we can learn anything from the typing."</p>

<p>Half an hour later three men stood in a tiny room, darkened, save for a
vivid patch of white on a screen a yard and a half square. Foyle and
Green watched the screen intently as the third man inserted the slide in
the powerful magic lantern. Magnified enormously, the typewritten
characters stood out vividly black against the white.</p>

<p>"What do you make of it, Green?" asked the superintendent after a
pause.<!-- Page 73 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>

<p>"Remington machine, latest pattern," answered the other briefly. "The
letter 'b' slightly battered, and the 'o' out of alignment. Used by a
beginner. There is double spacing between some of the lines and single
in others. A capital 'W' has been superimposed on a small one."</p>

<p>"That's so," agreed his superior thoughtfully. "You might see if the
Remington people can give us any help with that. If possible, get a list
of all the people who have bought machines during this last six weeks.
It's a long shot, but long shots sometimes come off. And if you come
into my room I'll give you a pistol. It'll be as well for you to carry
one while you're on this case. I was shot at myself, to-day."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir, I think I'll do without one," said the other quietly.
"My two fists are good enough for me."</p>

<p>"As you like," agreed Foyle, and Green departed on his mission. When he
returned, he walked into Foyle's room and laid a long list before his
chief. The superintendent cast his forefinger slowly down it.</p>

<p>"October 14," he read, "Mr. John Smith, c/o Israels, 404<span class="smcap">A</span> Grave Street,
Whitechapel." He looked up into the stolid face of Green. "That seems
like it," he went on. "You and I will take a little trip this evening,
Green. And I think you'd better have a pistol, after all."<!-- Page 74 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV"></a>CHAPTER XIV</h2>


<p>To all callers, relatives, friends, newspaper men, alike, Eileen
Meredith denied herself resolutely. "She has been rendered completely
prostrate by the shock," said the <i>Daily Wire</i> in the course of a highly
coloured character sketch. Other statements, more or less true, with
double and treble column photographs of herself, crept into other
papers. Night and day a little cluster of journalists hung about,
watching the front door, scanning every caller and questioning them when
they were turned away. Now and again one would go to the door and make a
hopeless attempt to see some member of the household.</p>

<p>But Eileen was not prostrate, in spite of the <i>Daily Wire</i>. She wanted
to be alone with her thoughts. Her gay vivacity had deserted her, and
she had become a sombre woman, with mouth set in rigid lines, and with a
fierce intensity for vengeance, none the less implacable because she
felt her impotence. In such unreasoning moods some women become
dangerous.</p>

<p>She had curtly rejected her father's suggestion that she should see a
doctor. Nor would she leave London to try and forget amid fresh
surroundings.</p>

<p>"Here I will stay until Bob's murderer is punished," she had said, and
her white teeth had come together viciously.</p>

<p>A night and a day had passed since her interview with Heldon Foyle.
Reflection had not convinced her<!-- Page 75 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span> that his cold reason was right. She
had made up her mind that Fairfield was the murderer. Nothing could
shake her from that conviction. Scotland Yard, she thought, was afraid
of him because he was a man of position. The square-faced superintendent
who had spoken so smoothly was probably trying to shield him. But she
knew. She was certain. Suppose she told all she knew? Her slim hands
clenched till the nails cut her flesh, as she determined that he should
pay the price of his crime. There was another justice than the law. If
the law failed her&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>A medical man or a student of psychology might have found an analysis of
her feelings interesting. She had reached the border-line of monomania,
yet he would have been a daring man who would have called her absolutely
insane. Except to Foyle she had said nothing of the feeling that
obsessed her.</p>

<p>With cool deliberation she unlocked a drawer of her escritoire and
picked out a dainty little ivory-butted revolver with polished barrel.
It was very small&mdash;almost a toy. She broke it apart and pushed five
cartridges into the chambers. With a furtive glance over her shoulder
she placed it in her bosom, and then hastily returned to her chair by
the fire and picked up a book. Her eyes skimmed the lines of type
mechanically. She read nothing, although she turned the pages.</p>

<p>Presently she flung the book aside and, without ringing for a maid,
dressed in an unobtrusive walking costume of deep black. She selected a
heavy fur muff and transferred the pistol to its interior. Her fingers
closed tightly over the butt. On her way to the door she was stopped by
an apologetic footman.<!-- Page 76 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>

<p>"There's a lot of persons from the newspapers waiting out in the
streets, Lady Eileen," he said.</p>

<p>"Indeed!" Her voice was cold and hard.</p>

<p>"They might annoy you. They stop every one who goes in or out."</p>

<p>She answered shortly and stepped out through the door he held open.
There was a quick stir among the reporters, and two of them hastily
detached themselves and confronted her, hats in hand. She forced a
smile.</p>

<p>"It's no use, gentlemen," she said. "I will not be interviewed." She
looked very dainty and pathetic as she spread out her hands in a
helpless little gesture. "Can I not appeal to your chivalry? You are
besieging a house of mourning. And, please&mdash;please, I know what is in
your minds&mdash;do not follow me."</p>

<p>She had struck the right note. There was no attempt to break her down.
With apologies the men withdrew. After all, they were gentlemen whose
intrusion on a private grief was personally repugnant to them.</p>

<p>The girl reached Scotland Yard while Heldon Foyle was still in talk with
Green. Her name at once procured her admission to him. She took no heed
of the chair he offered, but remained standing, her serious grey eyes
searching his face. He observed the high colour on her cheeks, and
almost intuitively guessed that she was labouring under some impulse.</p>

<p>"Please do sit down," he pleaded. "You want to know how the case is
progressing. I think we shall have some news for you by to-morrow. I
hope it will be good."</p>

<p>"You are about to make an arrest?"<!-- Page 77 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>

<p>The words came from her like a pistol-shot. A light shot into her eyes.</p>

<p>The detective shook his head. He had seen the look in her face once
before on the face of a woman. That was at Las Palmas, in a
dancing-hall, when a Portuguese girl had knifed a fickle lover with a
dagger drawn from her stocking. Lady Eileen was scarce likely to carry a
dagger in her stocking, but&mdash;his gaze lingered for a second on the muff,
which she had not put aside. It was queer that she should not withdraw
her hands.</p>

<p>"I don't say that. It depends on circumstances," he said gently.</p>

<p>Her face clouded. "I will swear that the man Fairfield killed him," she
cried passionately. "You will let him get away&mdash;you and your red tape."</p>

<p>He came and stood by her.</p>

<p>"Listen to me, Lady Eileen," he said earnestly. "Sir Ralph Fairfield did
not kill Mr. Grell. Of that I have proof. Will you not trust us and wait
a little? You are doing Sir Ralph a great injustice by your suspicions."</p>

<p>She laughed wildly, and flung herself away from him.</p>

<p>"You talk to me as though I were a schoolgirl," she retorted. "You can't
throw dust in my eyes, Mr. Foyle. He has bought you. You are going to
let him go. I know! I know! But he shall not escape."</p>

<p>The superintendent stroked his chin placidly. As if by accident he had
placed himself between her and the door. He had already made up his mind
what to do, but the situation demanded delicate handling.</p>

<p>"You will regret this when you are calmer," he said mildly.<!-- Page 78 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>

<p>He was uncertain in his mind whether to tell the distraught girl that
her lover was not dead&mdash;that the murdered man was a rogue whom probably
she had not seen or heard of in her life. He balanced the arguments
mentally pro and con, and decided that at all hazards he would preserve
his secret for the present. She took a step towards the door. She had
drawn herself up haughtily.</p>

<p>"Let me pass, please," she demanded.</p>

<p>He did not move. "Where are you going?" he asked. Her eyes met his
steadily.</p>

<p>"I am going to Sir Ralph Fairfield&mdash;to wring a confession from him, if
you must know," she said. "Let me pass, please."</p>

<p>"I will let you pass after you have given me the pistol you are carrying
in your muff," he retorted, holding out his hand.</p>

<p>Then the tigress broke loose in the delicately brought-up, gently
nurtured girl. She withdrew her right hand from her muff and Foyle
struck quickly at her wrist. The pistol clattered to the floor and the
man closed with her. It needed all his tremendous physical strength to
lift her bodily by the waist and place her, screaming and striking
wildly at his face with her clenched fists, in a chair. He held her
there with one hand and lifted one of the half-dozen speaking-tubes
behind his desk with the other.</p>

<p>In ten minutes Lady Eileen Meredith, in charge of a doctor and a
motherly-looking matron hastily summoned from the adjoining police
station in Cannon Row, was being taken back to her home in a state of
semi-stupor. Foyle picked up the dainty little revolver<!-- Page 79 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span> from the floor
and, jerking the cartridges out, placed it on the mantelpiece.</p>

<p>"You can never tell what a woman will do," he said to himself. "All the
same, I think I have saved Ralph Fairfield's life to-day."<!-- Page 80 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV"></a>CHAPTER XV</h2>


<p>Heldon Foyle was more deeply chagrined than he would have cared to admit
by the disappearance of Waverley. It was not only that one of the most
experienced men of the Criminal Investigation Department had fallen into
a trap and so placed his colleagues in difficulties. The very audacity
of the <i>coup</i> showed that the department was matched against no ordinary
opponents. There is a limit even to the daring of the greatest
professional criminals. If there were professionals acting in this
business, reflected the superintendent, the idea was none of theirs.
Besides, no professional would have written the letter threatening the
Yard. That was no bluff&mdash;the finger-prints proved that. To hold a
Scotland Yard man as a hostage was a game only to be played by those who
had much at stake.</p>

<p>Only one man shared Heldon Foyle's confidence. That was Sir Hilary
Thornton. To the Assistant Commissioner he talked freely.</p>

<p>"It's an ugly job for us, sir, there's no disguising that. Naturally,
they count on us keeping our mouths shut about Waverley. It's lucky he's
not a married man. If the story of the way he was bagged becomes public
property we shall be a laughing-stock, even if we get him out of his
trouble. And if we don't, the scandal will be something worse."</p>

<p>"Yes. It's bad&mdash;bad," agreed the Assistant Commissioner. "The Press must
not hear of this."<!-- Page 81 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>

<p>"Trust me," said Foyle grimly. "The Press won't."</p>

<p>"I don't like this affair of Lady Eileen Meredith," went on Sir Hilary.
"After all, she has a good right to know the truth. Wouldn't it be
better to let her know that Grell is alive?"</p>

<p>Foyle jingled some money in his trousers pocket.</p>

<p>"I hate it as much as you do, Sir Hilary. I can't take any chances,
though. Grell knows we know he is alive. When he finds that this girl
has not been told he may try to communicate with her, and then we may be
able to lay hands on him and Ivan, and so clear up the mystery. There's
another thing. As far as our inquiries through his solicitors and the
bank go, he couldn't have had much ready cash on him. He'll try to get
some sooner or later&mdash;probably through his friends. He's already tried
to approach Fairfield."</p>

<p>"I see," agreed the other in the tone of a man not quite convinced.
"Now, when are you going down to Grave Street again? You'll want at
least a dozen men."</p>

<p>"There won't be any trouble at Grave Street," answered Foyle with a
smile; "and if there is, Green and I will have to settle it. More men
would only be in the way. Our first job is to get hold of Waverley."</p>

<p>"But only two of you! Grave Street isn't exactly a nice place. If there
is trouble&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We'll risk that, sir," said Foyle, stiffening a trifle.</p>

<p>He went back to his own room and signed a few letters. Some words
through a speaking-tube brought Green in, stolid, gloomy, imperturbable.
The chief inspector accepted and lit a cigar. Through a cloud of smoke
the two men talked for a while. They were going<!-- Page 82 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span> on a mission that might
very easily result in death. No one would have guessed it from their
talk, which, after half an hour of quiet, business-like conversation,
drifted into desultory gossip and reminiscences.</p>

<p>"Sir Hilary wanted me to take a dozen men," said Foyle. "I told him the
two of us would be plenty."</p>

<p>"Quite enough, if we're to do anything," agreed Green. "I wouldn't be
out of it for a thousand. Poor old Waverley and I have put in a lot of
time together. I guess I owe him my life, if it comes to that."</p>

<p>Foyle interjected a question. The chief inspector lifted his cigar
tenderly from his lips.</p>

<p>"It was in the old garrotting days," he said. "Waverley and I were
coming down the Tottenham Court Road a bit after midnight&mdash;just off
Seven Dials. There were half-a-dozen men hanging about a corner, and one
of them tiptoed after us with a pitch plaster&mdash;you'll remember they used
to do the stuff up in sacking and pull it over your mouth from behind. I
never noticed anything, but Waverley did. The man was just about to
throw the thing over me when Waverley wheeled round and hit him clean
across the face with a light cane he was carrying. The chap was knocked
in the gutter and his pals came at us with a rush. A hansom driver
shouted to us to leave the man in the roadway to him, and hanged if he
didn't drive clean over him with the near-side wheel. That gave us our
chance. We hopped into the cab and got away without staying to see if
any one was hurt. But if Waverley hadn't hit out when he did I'd have
been a goner."</p>

<p>"I had a funny thing happen to me once in the Tottenham Court Road,"
said Foyle reminiscently. "I<!-- Page 83 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span> was an inspector then and big Bill Sladen
was working with me&mdash;he had a beautiful tenor voice, you will remember.
We were after a couple of confidence men and had a man we were towing
about to identify them. Well, we got 'em down to a saloon bar near the
Oxford Street end, but I daren't go in because they knew me. It was a
bitter cold night, with a cold wind and snow and sleet. So I stayed on
the opposite side of the road and induced Bill to go over and sing 'I am
but a Poor Blind Boy,' in the hope that our birds would call him in and
give him a drink. He hadn't been at it five minutes before a fiery,
red-headed little potman had knocked him head over heels in the gutter
and told him to go away. Bill could have broken the chap in two with his
little finger, but he daren't do anything. He came over to me and I sent
him back again. This time he did get invited inside. And there he stayed
for a full hour, while the witness and I stood shivering and wet and
miserable in the snow. We could hear him laughing and singing with the
best of 'em. They wouldn't let him come away. It was not until I took
all risks and marched in with the witness and arrested them that they
tumbled to the fact that he wasn't a real street singer." He glanced at
his watch. "You'd better go and have a rest, Green. Meet me here at
half-past twelve. We'll take a taxi to Aldgate and walk up from there.
And, by the way, here's a pistol. I needn't tell you not to use it
unless you've got to."<!-- Page 84 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI"></a>CHAPTER XVI</h2>


<p>A bitter wind was sweeping the Commercial Road, Whitechapel, as the two
detectives, each well muffled up, descended from their cab and walked
briskly eastwards. Save for a slouching wayfarer or two, shambling
unsteadily along, and little groups gathered about the all-night
coffee-stalls, the roads were deserted. Neither man had attempted any
disguise. It was not necessary now.</p>

<p>As they turned into Grave Street they automatically walked in the centre
of the roadway. There are some places where it is not healthy to walk at
night on shadowed pavements. They moved without haste and without
loitering, as men who know exactly what they have to do. From one of the
darkened houses a woman's shrill scream issued full of rage and terror.
It was followed by a man's loud, angry tones, the thud of blows,
shrieks, curses, and brutal laughter. Then the silence dropped over
everything again. The two men had apparently paid no heed. Even had they
been inclined to play the part of knights-errant in what was not an
uncommon episode in Grave Street, they knew that the woman who had been
chastised would probably have been the first to turn on them.</p>

<p>There was a side entrance to 404<span class="smcap">A</span>, which was the newspaper shop that
Foyle had cause to remember. He struck the grimy panel sharply with his
fist and waited. There was no reply. Again he knocked, and Green,<!-- Page 85 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
unbuttoning his greatcoat, flung it off and laid it across his arm. He
could drop it easily in case of an emergency. Still there was no answer
to the knock.</p>

<p>"Luckily I swore out a search warrant," muttered Foyle, and searched in
his own pockets for something. It was a jemmy of finely tempered steel
gracefully curved at one end. He inserted it in a crevice of the door
and, leaning his weight upon it, obtained an irresistible leverage.
There was a slight crack, and it swung inwards as the screws of the hasp
drew. The two men stepped within and, closing the door, stood absolutely
still for a matter of ten minutes. Not a sound betrayed that their
burglarious entry had alarmed any one.</p>

<p>Presently Green made a movement, and a vivid shaft of light from a
pocket electric lamp played along the narrow uncarpeted passage. The
superintendent gripped his jemmy tightly and turned towards the dirty
stairs. Then the light vanished as quickly as it had flared up, and from
above there came a sound of shuffling footsteps. Even Heldon Foyle, whom
no one would have accused of nervousness, felt his heart beat a trifle
more quickly. He knew that if he were as near the heart of the mystery
as he believed any second might see shooting. Penned as he and his
companion were in the narrow space of the passage barely three feet
wide, a shot fired from above could scarcely miss.</p>

<p>Crouching low, he sprang up the narrow staircase in three bounds, making
scarcely a sound. On the landing above he wound his arms tightly about
the person whose movements he had heard and whispered a quick, tense
command.<!-- Page 86 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>

<p>"Not a word, or it will be the worse for you. Let's have a light,
Green."</p>

<p>The prisoner kept very still, and Green flashed a light on his face. It
was that of a man of forty or so, with pronounced Hebrew features. His
greasy black hair was tangled in coarse curls, and a smooth black
moustache ran across his upper lip. A pair of shifty eyes were fixed
fearfully on Foyle, and the man murmured something in a guttural tongue.</p>

<p>"We are police officers. How many people are there in this house?"
demanded Foyle sternly, in a low voice. "You may as well answer in
English. Quietly, now."</p>

<p>He had released his hold round the Jew's waist, but stood with the jemmy
dangling by his side and with ears cocked ready for any sound. Green had
climbed the stairs and stood by his side.</p>

<p>Domiciliary visits are unfrequent in England, but the Jew was not
certain enough to stand upon a legal technicality. As a matter of fact,
the search warrant would have met the difficulty. He cringed before the
two men, whose faces he could not see, for Green had thrown his wedge of
light so that it showed up the man's sallow face and left all else in
darkness.</p>

<p>"I do not know why you have come," he answered, forming each word
precisely. "I have done nothing wrong. I am an honest newsagent. There
is only my wife, daughter, son, lodger in house."</p>

<p>"You are a receiver of stolen goods," answered Foyle, something, it must
be confessed, at a venture. "Don't trouble to deny it, Mr. Israels.
We're not after you this time&mdash;not if you treat us fairly. What<!-- Page 87 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span> about
this lodger of yours? Have you bought him a typewriter lately?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;yes. I help you all I can," protested the Jew, with an eagerness
that deceived neither of the detectives. There is no class of liar so
abysmal as the East-end criminal Jew. They will hold to a glib falsehood
with a temerity that nothing can shake. If there is no necessity to lie,
they lie&mdash;for practice, it is to be presumed. The best way to extract a
truth is to make a direct assertion by the light of apparent knowledge
and so sometimes obtain assent. Foyle knew the idiosyncrasies of the
breed. Hence the threat in his demand.</p>

<p>"I bought a typewriter&mdash;yes," went on Israels. "I think he was honest.
Didn't seem as though police after him."</p>

<p>"Which room is he in?"</p>

<p>Israels jerked a thumb upwards. "Next landing. Door on left," he
ejaculated nervously.</p>

<p>The superintendent pushed by the man. He knew that the critical moment
had come. With his quick judgment of men he had summed up Mr. Israels.
Whatever the Jew's morals, it was evident that he had a wholesome
respect for his own oily skin. He would not risk himself to save the
neck of another man. Foyle's intentions were simple. He would steal
quietly up the second flight of stairs, burst the door open if it were
locked, and seize the man he was in search of in his sleep. But his
plans were frustrated.</p>

<p>He had not taken two steps when a woman peeped from an adjoining room.
He caught one glimpse of her in the semi-darkness with a police whistle
at her<!-- Page 88 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span> lips. He sprang forward, and as he did so a shrill, ear-piercing
blast rang out. Green was close behind him.</p>

<p>She shrieked as the detective tore the whistle from her, and he felt her
slender figure entwine itself about him. Down he went, with his
companion on top of him, and another woman's loud hysterical cries added
to the pandemonium. Foyle picked himself up and, lifting the girl
bodily, flung her without ceremony into the room from which she had
emerged. From above a voice shouted something, and a knife whizzed
downwards and struck quivering in the bare boards of the landing,
grazing Green's shoulders.</p>

<p>All need for caution was gone now. Foyle had dropped his jemmy and his
hand closed over his pistol. Only as a last resource would he use it,
but if he had to&mdash;well, there could be no harm in having it handy. A
door slammed as the two detectives climbed the second flight of stairs.
Green flung himself against the one that had been indicated by Israels,
and the flimsy fastening gave way under the shock of his thirteen stone.
There was no one in the room. Savagely Heldon Foyle turned and caught
the handle of a second door. It turned, and they entered the room, empty
like the first, but with an open window looking out on a series of low
roofs a dozen feet below. And over the roofs a shadowy figure of a man
was clambering hurriedly. He could only dimly be seen.</p>

<p>Green clambered through on to the window-sill and dropped. He was
unlucky. A projecting piece of wood caught his foot, and he staggered
and lost time. Before he had recovered himself the fugitive was out<!-- Page 89 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span> of
sight, and the sound of his progress had ceased. Foyle called to him to
come back and, without waiting to see whether his orders were obeyed,
made his way back again to the first-floor landing. Israels was still
there, very white and shaky, as the superintendent struck a match.</p>

<p>"Where's that girl?" said the detective curtly. "The one who gave the
alarm."</p>

<p>"My daughter? She thought you were burglars. She didn't know."</p>

<p>"Where is she?"</p>

<p>Without waiting for a reply he entered the room whence she had emerged
and, striking another match, applied it to a gas-bracket. A fat woman
was sitting up in bed looking at him timorously. He paid no heed to her,
but stooped to look under the bed. When he straightened himself Green
had rejoined him.</p>

<p>"The girl gave us away," exclaimed Foyle. "Here, you, where is she
gone?" He shook the woman roughly by the shoulder. "Go to the bottom of
the stairs, Green, and see that no one slips in or out. Take that chap
outside down with you."</p>

<p>"My daughter?" exclaimed the woman helplessly. "She has gone to stay
with her aunt. We are respectable people. You frightened her. We don't
like the police coming here."</p>

<p>"Highly respectable," repeated Foyle under his breath. Aloud he said
menacingly, "We shall soon know whether you are respectable. Where does
the girl's aunt live?"</p>

<p>"Twenty-two Shadwell Lane," was the reply, glib and prompt.<!-- Page 90 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>

<p>Foyle looked for an instant penetratingly at her. Her eyes dropped. His
hand went to his pocket and he calmly lighted a cigar. Then he went
downstairs to where Green was on guard and politely apologised to
Israels. Casually he repeated the question he had put to the woman. Yes,
the Jew had seen his daughter go out. She said she was going to her
aunt. Her aunt lived at 48 Sussex Street.</p>

<p>"I see," said the superintendent quietly. "The fact is, of course, that
she is not your daughter, and that she has not gone to her aunt's. You
are in an awkward corner, my man," he went on, changing his tone and
moving a step nearer. "Better tell us the truth. Your wife has let me
know something."</p>

<p>As if mechanically, he was dangling a pair of shiny steel handcuffs in
his fingers. Handcuffs seldom formed a part of his equipment, but
to-night he had carried them with him on the off-chance that he might
have to use them. The Jew shrank away, but the sight had proved
effective.</p>

<p>"I'll tell all the truth," he whined, with an outspreading gesture of
his hands. "I've done no wrong. You can't hurt me. She came here a day
or two ago and paid five pounds for a week's lodging. I was to tell any
one who inquired that she was my daughter. She slept with my wife. What
harm was there? I am poor. Five pounds isn't picked up like that every
day. The man came afterwards. He said he was a journalist and asked me
to buy him a typewriting machine. I asked no questions. Why should I?"</p>

<p>His manner was that of a much-injured man. Foyle cut him short now and
again as he rambled on with a<!-- Page 91 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span> question. In half an hour he felt that he
had extracted a fair amount of truth, mingled though it was with cunning
lies. He guessed now that the woman whom he had vaguely seen was she
whose part in the mystery of the house in Grosvenor Gardens had always
been shadowy and vague. She could be none other than Lola Rachael,
little Lola of Vienna, otherwise the Princess Petrovska.<!-- Page 92 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span></p>

<p>There was nothing more to be done at Grave Street. Heldon Foyle remained
in the house while Green walked to the chief divisional station, and in
an hour or two the divisional inspector with a couple of men arrived.
Then Foyle saw to a strict search of the house from top to bottom.
Nothing there was that seemed to possess any great importance as bearing
on the case. The man who had fled over the roof had used a single room,
apparently as bed- and sitting-room, so it was to this place that the
detectives devoted chief attention.</p>

<p>"He must have been sleeping in his clothes," grumbled Green. "He hadn't
time to dress. There's the typewriter the note was written on."</p>

<p>He sat down before a rickety table and, inserting a piece of paper in
the machine, slowly tapped out the alphabet, and after a brief
inspection passed the paper on to the superintendent, who scanned it
casually, and was about to throw it away when something gripped his
attention.</p>

<p>"This looks queer," he muttered, and held the paper up slantingly away
from the gas-jet in order to examine it by what photographers call
transmitted light.</p>

<p>His brows were drawn together tightly. The sheet of paper which Green
had used was an ordinary piece of writing-paper. On its rough surface
Foyle had noted a slight sheen, unusual enough to attract his
attention.<!-- Page 93 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span> Even he would not have noticed it but for the angle in which
he had happened first to look at it when he took it from Green. It might
be an accidental fault in the manufacture of the paper. Yet, trivial as
it seemed, it was unusual, and one of the chief assets in detective work
is not to let the unusual go unexplained.</p>

<p>"It's the same typewriter. There can be no question of that," said
Green. "You can see that the 'b' is knocked about and the 'o' is out of
line."</p>

<p>"That's all right," said Foyle. "I wasn't thinking of that. It looks to
me as if there's some sympathetic writing on this."</p>

<p>He held the paper so that the heat from the gas-jet warmed it. Every
moment he expected that the heat would bring something to light on the
paper. He gave a petulant exclamation as nothing happened, and his eyes
roved over the table whence Green had taken the paper. He believed that
he was not mistaken, that there was something written which could be
brought to light if he knew how. He knew that there were chemicals that
could be used for secret communications which could only be revealed by
the use of other chemicals&mdash;a process something akin to development in
photography. It was unlikely, if the user of the room had used some
chemical agent, that he would have thought of destroying and concealing
it. But there was nothing on the table that suggested itself to Foyle as
having been used in the connection. Keenly he scrutinised the room, his
well-manicured hand caressing his chin.</p>

<p>"Ah!" he exclaimed at last. He had noted a small bottle of gum arabic
standing on the cast-iron mantelpiece.<!-- Page 94 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span></p>

<p>Now, gum arabic can be used for a variety of purposes, and it has the
merit of invisible ink of being made decipherable by quite a simple
process which minimises the risk of accidental disclosure. The
superintendent held the paper to the gas again for a few minutes. Then
from a corner of the room he collected a handful of dust&mdash;no difficult
process, for it was long since the place had felt the purifying
influence of a broom&mdash;and rubbed it hard on the rough surface of the
paper. A jumble of letters stood out greyly on the surface. He looked at
them hard, and Green, peeping over his shoulder, frowned.</p>

<p>"Cipher!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>It was undoubtedly cipher, but whether a simple or abstruse one Foyle
was in no position to judge. He had an elementary knowledge of the
subject, but he had no intention of attempting to solve it by himself.
There were always experts to whom appeal could be made. A successful
detective, like a successful journalist, is a man who knows the value of
specialists&mdash;who knows where to go for the information he wants. That
meaningless jumble of letters could only be juggled into sense by an
expert. Foyle nevertheless scrutinised them closely, more as a matter of
habit than of reading anything from them. They were&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>UJQW. BJNT. FJ. UJM. FJTV. UIYIQL. SK. DQUQZOKKEYJPK. ANUJ. M.Q.
NG. N. AYUQNQIX. IGZ. ANUJ. SIO. IGZ. SMPPN. RT. 12845 HGZVFSF.</p></blockquote>

<p>"We'll let Jones have a go at that," he said. "Anything else now?"<!-- Page 95 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>

<p>Some one handed him the knife that had been thrown at him on the landing
and a curious leather sheath that had been picked up near the bed. From
the bottom of the sheath depended a leather tassel. Foyle looked it over
and failed to discover any manufacturer's name. He slipped the weapon
into his pocket with the mental reflection that it looked Greek. The
search went on from attic to cellar, and profuse notes were taken of
everything found, with its exact position. The elaborate trouble taken
by these men to describe minutely in writing every little thing would
have seemed absurd to any one not versed in the ways of the Criminal
Investigation Department. Yet nothing was done that was not necessary.
An error of an inch in a measurement might make all the difference when
the case came on for trial.</p>

<p>Foyle and Green left the house in charge of the divisional man. Already
a description had been circulated of the man they had failed to
surprise; but as neither had caught more than a glimpse of a shadowy
figure in the darkness, they had had to rely on the descriptions given
by Israels and his wife. And even if that estimable pair had really
tried honestly to give a fair description of the man&mdash;which the
detectives thought was extremely doubtful&mdash;there could be little hope
that it was accurate. If the average man tries to describe the
appearance of his most intimate friend and then asks a stranger to
identify him, he will realise how misleading such descriptions may be
even at the best of times. Yet the Criminal Investigation Department had
to work with such material as they had.</p>

<p>Heldon Foyle was very silent as they trudged side<!-- Page 96 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span> by side out of
Whitechapel into the silent City streets&mdash;for there are no taxicabs to
be found in the East End at such hours. The case was developing; but
though he was beginning to have a hazy glimpse into some of its
workings, there was much that remained a mystery to him. His
questionings of Israels had satisfied him that the man who had escaped
was neither Grell nor Ivan. He could not blame himself for not effecting
an arrest. Looking back over the night's events, he could not see that
he could have taken further precaution. If he had taken more men the
escape would have occurred just the same over the roofs, for he would
still have felt it his duty to question Israels. He could not have
foreseen that the ready-witted Lola was there, nor that she should have
so ingeniously given the alarm. The luck had been against him.</p>

<p>Nevertheless he had gained an important fact. Lola was in London and was
obviously acting in concert with Grell. It was easier to look for two
persons than one. Sooner or later he would lay hands on them and solve
the mystery of the murder. He clenched his fists resolutely as his
thoughts carried him away. Meanwhile there was the cipher. If that could
be de-coded it might be valuable.</p>

<p>Green's voice broke in upon his thoughts.</p>

<p>"We didn't find anything bearing on Waverley."</p>

<p>"Waverley?" repeated Foyle. "Oh yes, I had almost forgotten him."</p>

<p>For an hour after they had reached Scotland Yard the superintendent
laboured at his desk, collecting reports and writing fresh chapters in
the book which<!-- Page 97 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span> held all the facts in relation to the crime, so far as
he knew them. He slipped the result of his labours at last in an
envelope and left them over to be dealt with by the inspector in charge
of the Registry, which is a department that serves as official memory to
Scotland Yard.</p>

<p>"That is all right," he said, and stretched himself.</p>

<p>Some one knocked at the door. The handle turned and an erect man with
his right arm carried in a black silk handkerchief improvised into a
sling entered the room. It was Detective-Inspector Waverley.<!-- Page 98 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII"></a>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>


<p>Heldon Foyle was on his feet in a second, and he pushed a chair towards
his subordinate. Detective-Inspector Waverley sat down and drummed
nervously on his knees with the fingers of his left hand.</p>

<p>"Well, you've got back," said the superintendent in a non-committal
tone. "We were beginning to wonder what had happened to you. I hope that
arm of yours is not badly hurt. What has been the trouble?"</p>

<p>The inspector winced and sat bolt upright in his chair.</p>

<p>"I guess I was to blame, sir," he said. "I fell into a trap like a
new-joined cabbage-boy. This man, Ivan Abramovitch, must have known that
he was followed by a couple of us, so he threw off Taylor, who was with
me, very simply, by going into a big outfitter's place in the City. I
dodged round to a second entrance and, sure enough, he came out there. I
couldn't get word to Taylor, so I picked him up, and a pretty dance he
led me through a maze of alleys up the side of Petticoat Lane and round
about by the Whitechapel Road. You will know the sort of neighbourhood
it is there. Well, I suppose I must have got a bit careless, for in
taking a narrow twist in one of those alleys some one dropped on me from
behind. I hit out and yelled, but I didn't get a second chance, for my
head was bumped hard down on the pavement and I went to sleep for good
and plenty. There were a couple of<!-- Page 99 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span> men in it, for I could hear 'em
talking before I became properly unconscious. They dragged me along,
linking their arms in mine, and we got into a cab. I guess the driver
thought I was drunk, and that they were my pals helping me home.</p>

<p>"When I came round my head was bandaged up, and I was in quite a decent
little room, lying on a couch, with Mr. Ivan Abramovitch sitting
opposite to me. I couldn't give a guess where it was, for the window
only looked out on a blank wall. I sat up, and he grinned at me.</p>

<p>"'I am a police officer,' I said. 'How did I get here?'</p>

<p>"'I brought you,' he says with a grin. 'You were taking too great an
interest in my doings for my liking. Now I am going to take an interest
in yours.'</p>

<p>"At that I jumped for him and got a knife through my arm for my pains.
After he'd sworn at me like a trooper in English, French, and Russian
for about ten minutes he bandaged up the cut with his handkerchief, and
told me if I made any more fuss I was in for trouble. Some one knocked
at the door, but he ordered them off.</p>

<p>"'You won't get away from here alive without permission if I can help
it,' he said; 'but if you do, you won't be able to identify any one but
myself. If you take it coolly there'll be no harm come to you.'</p>

<p>"I tried to bluff a bit, but he just laughed. And then I stayed with him
in the same room up to within an hour or two ago, when some one came
into the house and he was summoned outside the door. They had an excited
pow-wow, and I could hear a woman talking.<!-- Page 100 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span> Finally, the man came back
and told me they'd determined to let me go. He put a handkerchief over
my eyes, and after a while I was taken down into what I thought was a
taxicab. I was turned out a quarter of an hour ago at the Blackfriars
end of the Embankment."</p>

<p>Foyle was by now striding up and down the office, his hands thrust deep
in his trousers pockets. He paused long enough to blow down a
speaking-tube and put a quick question.</p>

<p>"What was the number of the cab?"</p>

<p>"It had no police number. Its index mark was A.A. 4796."</p>

<p>The superintendent drew from his pocket a little black book, such as is
carried by every police officer in London. On the outside was inscribed
in white letters: "Metropolitan Police. Pocket Directory." He turned
over the pages until he found what he wanted. A messenger had pushed
open the door.</p>

<p>"Southampton registration," said the superintendent. "Johns, get through
on the 'phone to the Southampton police, and ask 'em to trace the owner
of this car the moment the county council offices open."</p>

<p>The messenger disappeared, and he turned on Waverley.</p>

<p>"The number's probably a false one&mdash;a board slipped over the real
number, as they did in the Dalston case when some American toughs went
through that jeweller a month or two back. We might as well look into
it, though. These people are wily customers, or they wouldn't have kept
you from seeing the rest of the gang. They tried to frighten us by
threatening to<!-- Page 101 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span> make away with you. I think it likely that they found it
rather a nuisance to look after you&mdash;especially when Green and I tumbled
on to some of their people an hour ago. You haven't exactly covered
yourself with glory, Waverley, but under the circumstances I shall take
no disciplinary action. Now go and write out a full report, and then go
home. The police surgeon will recommend what leave of absence you want
to get over the stab in the arm. Good night&mdash;or rather, good morning."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir. Good morning, sir."</p>

<p>Foyle never forgot discipline, which is as necessary, or more necessary
within limits, in a detective service as in any other specialised
business. To have sympathised with Waverley would have been bad policy.
He had been made to feel that he had blundered in some way, and the
feeling with which he had entered the room, that he was a martyr to
duty, had vanished in the conviction that he was simply a fool.</p>

<p>Foyle lit a cigar and fell into a reverie that lasted perhaps ten
minutes. He was glad that Waverley was safe, but a little disgusted that
he had failed to baffle the precautions taken while he was a prisoner,
and so have learnt something that might have been of value in the
investigations. Presently he lifted the telephone receiver and ordered a
taxicab from the all-night rank in Trafalgar Square. In a little while
he was being whirled homeward.</p>

<p>Not till midday next day did he arrive at the Yard. A slip of paper was
lying on his desk&mdash;the record of a telephone message from the
Southampton police. It read<!-- Page 102 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"Halford, Chief Constable, Southampton, to Foyle, C.I.D., London.</p>

<p>"Car No. A.A. 4796 belongs to Mr. J. Price, The Grange, Lyndhurst.
Mr. Price is an old resident in the neighbourhood and a man of
means. The car is a six-cylinder Napier."</p></blockquote>

<p>"As I thought," commented Heldon Foyle thoughtfully, tearing the paper
into little bits and dropping them into the waste-paper basket. "The
number was a false one. They knew that Waverley would have a look at the
number. Oh, these people are cunning&mdash;cunning."</p>

<p>Green found him, half an hour later, hard at work with the collection of
typewritten sheets which formed the book of the case. Foyle was still
juggling with his jig-saw puzzle, trying to fit fresh facts in their
proper position to old facts.</p>

<p>"Well?" asked the superintendent abruptly.</p>

<p>Green read from a paper in his hand.</p>

<p>"Taylor, who is watching the Duke of Burghley's House in Berkeley
Square, has just telephoned that a woman who corresponds to the
description of Lola Rachael has just been admitted and is still there."</p>

<p>Into Foyle's alert eyes there shot a gleam of interest.</p>

<p>"You don't say so?" he muttered. And then, more alertly, "Is he still on
the telephone? If so, tell him to detain her should she come out before
I can get down. He must be as courteous as possible. We mustn't lose her
now. And send a man down at once to bring Wills, the butler at Grosvenor
Gardens, here. He's the only man who saw the veiled woman enter the
house on the night of the murder."<!-- Page 103 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX"></a>CHAPTER XIX</h2>


<p>From behind the curtains of the sitting-room Eileen Meredith could see
two men occasionally pass and re-pass the house. They did not go by
often, but she knew that even if she could not see them they always held
the house in view. They were not journalists&mdash;they were more sedate,
older men. Nor did they molest any one who entered or left the house.
They merely exercised a quiet, unwearying, unobtrusive surveillance, and
Eileen knew that Heldon Foyle had taken his own way of preventing her
from seeing Sir Ralph Fairfield. She felt certain that were she to leave
the house the men would follow her. She did not guess, however, that
Foyle had intended them to give her an opportunity of discovering their
presence. She would be the more unlikely to persist in her rash resolve
if she knew it would be frustrated. Nor did she know that Fairfield was
equally closely watched in all his comings and goings.</p>

<p>The hysterical outbreak that had been provoked by the superintendent's
penetration of her doings when she had visited his office at Scotland
Yard had been followed by hours of almost complete collapse. To her
father enough had been told to make him hurriedly summon a specialist.
The doctor explained.</p>

<p>"I have known similar cases follow a great shock. She is mentally
unbalanced on one point. Unless anything occurs to excite her in
connection with that, time<!-- Page 104 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span> will effect a cure. She must not be opposed
in her wishes, and I would suggest that she be taken out of London and
an effort made to distract her. Plenty of society, outdoor
amusements&mdash;anything to occupy her mind."</p>

<p>"I suggested that we should leave London," said Lord Burghley gloomily.
"She refuses."</p>

<p>"Then don't press her. Ask her friends to visit her, and don't let her
leave the house except with a competent attendant."</p>

<p>So it was that Eileen found herself practically a prisoner in her own
home. She received the visitors invited by her father at first with a
mechanical courtesy, but later on with an assumption of cheerfulness
that deceived her father and even to more extent the doctor. She had
begun to realise that she would never shake off the vigilance which
surrounded her until she had convinced folk that she had regained her
normal spirits. Her capabilities as an actress, which had won for her
leading parts in many amateur plays, had never been taxed so hardly. But
then she had invariably been cast for comedy. Now she felt she was
playing tragedy. For night and day she never forgot. Always there was
one thought hammering at her brain.</p>

<p>She withdrew into the room as a neat little motor-brougham halted at the
door. In a little while Mrs. Porter-Strangeways was announced.
Reluctantly Eileen condescended to welcome the portly, middle-aged dame
who was tacitly recognised as being the leader of American society in
London. The girl smiled brightly as the woman rose to greet her with
both arms outstretched.<!-- Page 105 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is so good of you, dear Mrs. Porter-Strangeways," she exclaimed. "I
have only my friends to look forward to now."</p>

<p>Mrs. Porter-Strangeways indicated her companion by some subtle means of
her own.</p>

<p>"You poor girl!" she exclaimed, throwing just the right reflection of
sympathy into her not unmusical voice. "I called before, but you were
unfit to see any one then. I took the liberty of bringing a friend to
see you&mdash;the Princess Petrovska."</p>

<p>The name conveyed nothing to Eileen. She knew not how the woman she
faced was concerned in the tangle in which she herself was involved. She
saw only a slim, beautifully dressed woman, whose age might have been
somewhere between thirty and forty, and who still laid claim to a
gipsy-like beauty. The dark eyes of the Princess dwelt upon the girl
with a sort of well-bred curiosity. Mrs. Porter-Strangeways imparted
information in a swift whisper.</p>

<p>"A Russian title, I believe. Met her in Rome two years ago. She is a
delightful woman&mdash;so bright and happy, though I believe, poor dear, she
had a terrible time before her husband died. She called on me yesterday
and asked me to bring her to see you. She's so interested in you. You
don't mind?"</p>

<p>The quick thought that she was being made a show of caused a spasm to
flicker across Eileen's face. Almost instantly she regained her
composure, and for half an hour Mrs. Porter-Strangeways prattled on. The
other took little part in the conversation. Eileen could feel that the
Princess was watching her closely under her cast-down eyelashes. The
woman repelled and yet fas<!-- Page 106 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>cinated her. When the time came for
leave-taking she found herself giving a pressing invitation to the other
to call again. With a smile of satisfaction the Princess promised.</p>

<p>They had not been gone a quarter of an hour when the Princess was
announced alone. Eileen, a little astonished, received her
questioningly.</p>

<p>"I had to see you alone," explained the older woman. "I have something
of importance to say to you&mdash;that's why I made Mrs. Porter-Strangeways
bring me. I feared that you would not see me otherwise."</p>

<p>"To see me alone?" repeated Eileen, with the air of one completely
mystified. Then, as the other nodded grimly, she closed the door of the
room.</p>

<p>With a murmured "Pardon me" the Princess walked across the room and
turned the key. "It will be better so," she said. "What I have to say
must not be overheard. The life of a&mdash;some one may depend on secrecy."</p>

<p>Eileen had begun to wonder if her strange visitor were mad. There was
something, however, in her quiet, methodical manner that forbade the
assumption. The Princess Petrovska had settled herself gracefully in a
great arm-chair.</p>

<p>"No, I am not mad." She answered the unspoken question. "I am quite in
my senses, I assure you. I have come to you with a message from one you
think dead&mdash;from Robert Grell."</p>

<p>The room reeled before Eileen's eyes. She clutched the mantelpiece with
one hand to steady herself.</p>

<p>"From one I <i>think</i> dead!" she repeated. "Bob <i>is</i> dead." She gripped
the other woman fiercely by the<!-- Page 107 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span> shoulder and almost shook her in the
intensity of her emotion. "He is dead, I tell you. What do you mean? I
know he is dead. Do not lie to me. He is dead."</p>

<p>The Princess Petrovska glanced gravely up into the strained features of
the girl. Her own face was a mask.</p>

<p>"Calm yourself, Lady Eileen," she said. "You have been made the victim
of a wicked deceit. He is not dead&mdash;but a man wonderfully like him is. I
have come here at his request to relieve your mind." She dropped her
voice to a whisper. "At the same time, he is in grave danger, and you
can help him."</p>

<p>The girl's hands dropped to her side, and she regarded her visitor
helplessly. A new hope was beginning to steal into her heart, but her
reason was all on the other side.</p>

<p>"He is dead," she protested faintly. "Fairfield killed him. Why should
he hide if he is not dead? Why should he not come here himself? Why
should he send you?"</p>

<p>"Don't be a fool," retorted the other impatiently, and the impertinence
of the words had the effect intended of bracing the half-fainting girl.
"He does not come because to do so would be madness&mdash;because if he
showed himself he would be at once arrested by Scotland Yard detectives.
They believe him to be the murderer of his double&mdash;a man named
Goldenburg. There is a note he gave me for you."</p>

<p>The letters danced before Eileen's eyes as she tore open the thin
envelope and held what was undoubtedly Robert Grell's writing in her
shaking hand. She was startled as never before in her life save when she
heard<!-- Page 108 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span> of the murder. Slowly she read, the words biting into her brain&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"<span class="smcap">Dearest</span>,&mdash;Forgive me for not letting you know before that I am
safe. I had no means of communicating with you with safety. The man
who is dead was killed by no wish of mine. Yet I dared not run the
risk of arrest. The bearer of this is an old friend of mine who
will herself be in peril by delivering this. Trust her, and destroy
this. She will tell you how to keep in touch with me."</p></blockquote>

<p>There was no signature. Mechanically Eileen tore the letter in two and
dropped the fragments on the blazing fire. She felt the dark eyes of the
Princess upon her as she did so. A spasm of jealousy swept across her at
the thought that this woman should have been trusted, should have had
the privilege of helping Grell rather than herself. She strove to push
it aside as unworthy. He was alive. He was alive. The thought was
dominant in her mind. She could have sung for very joy.</p>

<p>"Well?" asked the Princess.</p>

<p>"I don't understand," said Eileen wearily. "He does not explain. There
is nothing clear in the note but that he is alive."</p>

<p>"He dare say no more. We&mdash;that is&mdash;he's succeeded in evading the police
so far. If by any chance that letter had fallen into their hands, it
would have told them no more than they knew at present."</p>

<p>"Where is he?" demanded Eileen. "I must go to him."<!-- Page 109 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, that will never do. You would be followed. I will give any message
for you. You can help, but not in that way. He is in need of money. Have
you any of your own? Can you let him have, say, five hundred pounds at
once?"</p>

<p>The girl reflected a moment.</p>

<p>"There is my jewellery," she said at last. "He&mdash;or you&mdash;can raise more
than five hundred on that. Wait a moment."</p>

<p>She left the room, and a smile flitted across the grave face of the
Princess. A few moments later she returned with a little silver casket
in her hands.</p>

<p>"And now," she said, "tell me what happened. Who killed this man
Goldenburg?"</p>

<p>The Princess Petrovska gave a dainty little shrug.</p>

<p>"Mr. Grell shall tell you that in his own fashion," she said. "Listen."</p>

<p>For ten minutes she talked rapidly, now and again writing something on a
slip of paper and showing it to Eileen. The girl nodded in
comprehension, occasionally interjecting a question. At last the
Princess rose.</p>

<p>"You fully understand?" she said.</p>

<p>"I fully understand," echoed Eileen.<!-- Page 110 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span></p>

<p>Heldon Foyle had been prepared to take any risk rather than allow the
Princess Petrovska to escape him again. There was nothing against her
but suspicion. It was for him to find evidence that might link her with
the crime. It is in such things that the detective of actuality differs
from the detective of fiction. The detective of fiction acts on moral
certainties which would get the detective of real life into bad trouble.
To arrest the Princess was out of the question; even to detain her might
make matters awkward. Yet the superintendent had made up his mind to
afford Wills the butler a sight of her at all costs. If Wills identified
her it would be at least another link in the chain of evidence that was
being forged.</p>

<p>He carried the butler in a taxicab with him to the nearest corner to the
Duke of Burghley's house. A well-groomed man sauntered up to them and
shook hands warmly with Foyle.</p>

<p>"She has not come out yet," he said.</p>

<p>"Good," exclaimed Foyle. "Come on, Wills. You have a good look at this
woman when she does come out, and stoop down and tie your shoe-lace if
she's anything like the woman who visited Robert Grell on the night of
the murder. Be careful now. Don't make any mistakes. If you identify her
you'll probably have to swear to her in court."</p>

<p>"But I never saw her face," complained Wills help<!-- Page 111 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>lessly. "I told you I
was not certain I'd know her again."</p>

<p>He was palpably nervous and unwilling to play the prominent part that
had been assigned to him. Foyle laughed reassuringly.</p>

<p>"Never mind. You have a look at her, old chap. You never know in these
cases. You may remember her when you see her. Every one walks
differently, and you may spot her by that. It won't do any harm if you
don't succeed."</p>

<p>He led Wills to a spot a few paces away from the house, but out of view
of any one looking from the windows, and gave him instructions to remain
where he was. He himself returned to the corner where Taylor, the
detective-inspector who had greeted them when they drove up, was
waiting. The other end of that side of the square was guarded by one of
Taylor's assistants. Lola was trapped&mdash;if Foyle wished her to be
trapped.</p>

<p>He beckoned to a uniformed constable who was pacing the other side of
the road. The man nodded&mdash;detectives whatever their rank are never
saluted&mdash;and took up his position a few paces away.</p>

<p>They had not long to wait. A taxicab whizzed up to the house, evidently
summoned by telephone. Wills was staring as though fascinated at the
slim, erect figure of the woman outlined on the steps of the house. He
half stooped, then straightened himself up again. The superintendent
muttered an oath under his breath and nodded to the loitering policeman.
The constable immediately sprang into the roadway with arm outstretched,
and the cab, which was just gathering way,<!-- Page 112 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span> was pulled up with a jerk.
The blue uniform is more useful in some cases than the inconspicuous
mufti of the C.I.D.</p>

<p>"Get hold of Wills and bring him after us to Malchester Row Police
Station." And, opening the door, he stepped within as the driver dropped
in the clutch.</p>

<p>The Princess had half risen and gave a little cry of dismay at the
intrusion. With grim, set face the detective adjusted his tall form to
the limits of the cab and sat down beside her. His hand encircled her
wrist, and he forced her back to the seat.</p>

<p>"I shouldn't try to open the door if I were you," he said quietly. "You
might fall out."</p>

<p>The woman dropped back and did some quick thinking. She had no
difficulty in guessing who Foyle was, and she could scarcely have failed
to see the staring figure of the butler as she left the Duke of
Burghley's house. She fenced for time, doing the astonished, outraged,
half-frightened innocent to perfection.</p>

<p>"What does this mean? How dare you molest me? Where are you taking me?"</p>

<p>The detective smiled easily as he answered in the formal words of C.I.D.
custom: "I am a police officer&mdash;perhaps I needn't tell you that&mdash;and I
am taking you to Malchester Row Police Station."</p>

<p>"To arrest me? You would dare? Do you know I am the Princess Petrovska?
There is some mistake. I shall appeal to the Russian Ambassador. What do
you say I have done? I am a friend of Lady Eileen Meredith, the daughter
of the Duke of Burghley. She will tell you I have only just left her.
You are confusing me with some one else."<!-- Page 113 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>

<p>It was admirably done. The mixture of indignation and haughtiness might
have imposed upon some people, and the threat of appeal to the Russian
Ambassador had been very adroit. Heldon Foyle merely nodded.</p>

<p>"This is not arrest," he replied. "It is not even detention&mdash;unless you
force me to it. I am inviting you to accompany me to give an account of
your movements on the night that Harry Goldenburg was murdered. I will
call your bluff, Lola, and we will call at the ambassador's if you
like."</p>

<p>She made a gesture with one hand, as of a fencer acknowledging a hit,
and, turning her head, smiled sweetly into his face. Nevertheless, in
spite of everything, she felt a little nervous. She had gone to see
Eileen with her eyes not fully open to the risk she ran. Deftly used,
newspapers have their uses. In supplying the story of the murder to the
pressmen, Foyle had omitted all mention of the finding of the miniature.
The woman had not known that Scotland Yard had a portrait of her, and
had deemed it unlikely that she would be recognised by the watchers of
the house. Although she had lived by her wits in many quarters of the
world, she had hitherto avoided trouble with the police in England. She
wondered how much Foyle knew. It was evidently of no use trying to
impress him with the importance of her rank and connections. Princesses
are cheap in Russia.</p>

<p>"You are Mr. Heldon Foyle, of course," she said. "I have heard that you
are very clever. I don't see what I can have had to do with the murder,
even if I am Lola Rachael&mdash;which I admit."</p>

<p>"We shall see. Can you prove where you were be<!-- Page 114 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>tween ten o'clock, when
you left the Palatial Hotel, and midnight on that date?"</p>

<p>She laughed merrily. "You are not so clever as I thought," she
exclaimed. "Do you think that I am a murderess? I went straight to an
hotel near Charing Cross&mdash;the Splendid&mdash;and caught the nine o'clock boat
train to Paris. It is easily proved."</p>

<p>Foyle shifted to the seat opposite, so that he could see her face more
easily.</p>

<p>"Then you don't deny that you visited Grosvenor Gardens that night, that
you were admitted by Ivan Abramovitch, Grell's valet, and taken to his
study?"</p>

<p>"Of course I do," she retorted laughingly. "If that's all you've got to
go upon you may as well let me go now."</p>

<p>"Very well. We shall see," he answered.</p>

<p>The cab stopped at Malchester Row Police Station.<!-- Page 115 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI"></a>CHAPTER XXI</h2>


<p>To the constable who opened the cab door Foyle gave quick instructions
in a low voice. The Princess Petrovska found herself ushered into a
plainly furnished waiting room, decorated with half-a-dozen photographic
enlargements of the portraits of high police officials and a
photogravure of "Her Majesty the Baby." There the policeman left her.</p>

<p>Foyle came to her a moment later. His couple of questions to the cabman
as he paid him had not been fruitful. He had been ordered by the lady to
drive to Waterloo Station. It was a fairly obvious ruse, which would
have had the effect of effectually confusing her trail, for from there
she might have taken train, tube, omnibus, tram, or cab again to about
any point in London.</p>

<p>"I am sorry," he apologised. "We shall have to keep you here for an hour
or two while your statements are verified."</p>

<p>"I don't mind," she countered lightly. "It will be an amusing
experience. I have never seen a police station before. Perhaps you would
like to show me over while we're waiting, Mr. Foyle."</p>

<p>The superintendent was admiring her confidence a little ruefully. A
pleasant-faced, buxom woman tapped at the door, and Lola eyed her with
misgivings. Foyle's blue eyes were fixed on her face.</p>

<p>"I am afraid I must deny myself that pleasure," he<!-- Page 116 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span> said suavely. "There
are other matters which will take up our time. First, I shall be obliged
if you will let the matron here search you."</p>

<p>The nonchalance of the Princess Petrovska had disappeared in a flash,
and Foyle noted her quick change of countenance. She had recollected she
was carrying Lady Eileen Meredith's jewels. They would inevitably be
found, if she were searched. She was not so much worried by what
explanation she could give as to what would be the result of a
questioning of Eileen. Angrily defiant, she was on her feet in a flash.</p>

<p>"You have no right to search me. I am not under arrest," she declared.</p>

<p>Foyle knew she was right. What he was doing was flagrantly unlawful
unless he charged her with some offence. Yet there are times when it is
necessary for a police officer to put a blind eye to the telescope and
to do technically illegal things in order that justice may not be
defeated. This he felt was one of the occasions. He ignored her
protestations and left the room, closing the door after him. For a brief
moment the woman forgot the breeding of the Princess Petrovska in the
fiery passion of Lola the dancer. But if she meditated resistance, a
second's reflection convinced her that it would be futile. The matron,
for all her good-tempered face, was well developed muscularly, and did
not seem the kind of woman to be trifled with. The Princess submitted
with as good a grace as she could muster.</p>

<p>As the woman drew forth the casket of jewels Lola made one false move.
She laid a slim-gloved hand on her arm.<!-- Page 117 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span></p>

<p>"If you want to earn ten pounds you will give me that back," she said
softly.</p>

<p>The matron shook her head with so resolute an expression that the word
"twenty," which trembled on the Princess Petrovska's lips, was never
uttered. Gathering in her hands the articles she had found, she stepped
outside. In three minutes her place was taken by Foyle. He quietly
returned to her everything but the jewel case. This he held between his
fingers.</p>

<p>"Where did you get this?" he demanded. His voice was keyed to the stern,
official tone he knew so well how to assume.</p>

<p>She gripped the side of a chair tightly.</p>

<p>"What is that to do with you? It is mine. Give it to me."</p>

<p>"Not unless you can prove it is yours. If you do not, I shall charge you
with being in possession of property suspected to be stolen."</p>

<p>She bit her lips until the blood came. Her face had become very pale. If
the threat were meant seriously&mdash;and she could see no reason why it
should not be&mdash;she was in an awkward predicament. Ordinarily she had
ready resource, a fertile genius for invention. Now her wits seemed to
have deserted her. Cudgel her brains as she would, she could see no way
out of the difficulty. To boldly state that the jewels had been
entrusted to her by Eileen would involve opening up a fresh line of
inquiry for the C.I.D. men that might have disastrous results. Nor was
there any person who might bear out a story invented on the spur of the
moment.</p>

<p>"Well?" He spoke coldly.<!-- Page 118 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span></p>

<p>"I refuse to tell you where I got them," she retorted. "You must do as
you like."</p>

<p>"Then it is my duty to warn you that anything you say may be used in
evidence against you. You will be charged." He opened the door and cried
down the corridor, "Reserve!" To the constable who answered he indicated
the Princess by a nod. "Take this woman to the detention room. She will
be paraded for identification in half an hour."</p>

<p>The detention room of a London police station is a compromise between
the comparative luxury of a waiting-room and the harshness of a cell.
Like a waiting-room it is furnished with chairs and tables, and like a
cell its door is provided with a strong, self-acting lock. The Princess
Petrovska gritted her teeth viciously as she was left alone, and paid no
heed to the magazines and papers left on the table&mdash;a consideration for
visitors that had not been discernible in the waiting-room.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Foyle had set every available man of the divisional
detachment of the C.I.D. busily at work. A couple had been sent to
verify the account given by the woman of her movements on the night when
the murder occurred. The remainder had been sent to bring in a score of
women, the wives and daughters of inspectors and other senior officers.</p>

<p>Detective-Inspector Taylor had turned up with Wills, who was informed of
the part he had to play.</p>

<p>"You say you couldn't recognise the woman who came out of Lord
Burghley's house. Now we're going to give you another try. We don't want
you to pick any one out unless you're absolutely sure. Mind that."</p>

<p>Some of the women who had been fetched in by the<!-- Page 119 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span> detectives were
rejected by Foyle as being too unlike the Princess. He intended the
identification test to be as fair as possible. The ten who finally took
their places in the high-pitched charge room were as nearly like the
Princess in build and dress as could be managed from the choice
afforded. They stood in a row on the opposite side of the room from the
steel-railed dock and the high desk. Then Lola was brought in. Her head
was held high, and her lips curled superciliously as she took in the
arrangements.</p>

<p>"Please choose a position among these ladies," said Foyle urbanely. "You
may stand anywhere you like."</p>

<p>There was an angry glitter in her dark eyes as she obeyed. She was not
the sort of woman to risk a scene uselessly. Then Wills was brought in.
Foyle put a formal question to him.</p>

<p>"Have you seen any of these ladies before? Don't be in a hurry to
answer. Walk down the line and take a good look at each."</p>

<p>Wills slowly carried out his instructions. As he reached the last woman
he shook his head. Lola's eyes caught those of Foyle with a glance of
malicious triumph. But the superintendent was not done yet.</p>

<p>"Walk round the room, if you please, ladies&mdash;from left to right. No, a
little quicker. Now, Wills, see if you can recognise any of them by
their walk."</p>

<p>Three times they made the circuit of the room, while the butler darted
nervous glances from one to the other.</p>

<p>"It's no good, sir," he confessed at last. "I don't know any of 'em."</p>

<p>To Foyle the result was not unexpected. He had<!-- Page 120 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span> adopted the expedient as
a forlorn chance of linking up the Princess with the crime. Now it had
failed, he intended to try other measures. He dismissed Wills and the
women with a nod of caution not to speak of the formality they had
witnessed, and at a nod from him a uniformed inspector stood up by the
high desk pen in hand.</p>

<p>"Do you charge this woman, Mr. Foyle?" he asked.</p>

<p>Taylor had ranged up against her, and almost unconsciously she found
herself standing by the desk facing the officer.</p>

<p>She searched the superintendent's inflexible face to see if it gave any
sign of relenting. Foyle was calm, inscrutable, business-like. That was
what had struck her from the moment she entered the police station&mdash;the
cool, business-like fashion in which these men had dealt with the
situation. There were no histrionics. They might have been clerks
engaged in some monotonous work for all the emotion they evinced. They
treated her as impersonally as though she was a bale of goods about
which there was some dispute.</p>

<p>She was not a person easily daunted, but the atmosphere chilled her.</p>

<p>She reflected quickly that her refusal to explain the possession of the
jewels was playing into Heldon Foyle's hands. He would guess that they
were Eileen Meredith's&mdash;in any case, she could not stop him from seeing
and questioning the girl. What advantage would it be to be placed under
lock and key? Before the superintendent could reply she had made up her
mind.</p>

<p>"One moment. I can explain how I got the jewels if I can see Mr. Foyle
alone."<!-- Page 121 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span></p>

<p>The inspector looked hesitatingly at the superintendent, who was
stroking his chin with his hand. Foyle murmured an assent and led the
way back to the detention room. The woman swung round to him quickly
once they were alone.</p>

<p>"Those jewels were entrusted to me for a particular purpose by Lady
Eileen Meredith," she said peremptorily. "That is all you have any right
to know. You can easily ring her up and ask her. Do it at once and let
me go."</p>

<p>"Very well," he said imperturbably. "I shall keep you here until I have
done so."</p>

<p>But it was not to Berkeley Square that he telephoned from the privacy of
the divisional C.I.D. offices. It was to Scotland Yard. Within five
minutes Chief Inspector Green was setting out from the great red-brick
building to see, first, the Duke of Burghley and, secondly, Lady Eileen
Meredith. A full hour passed away, and Foyle received the result of the
inquiries into Petrovska's movements. Her alibi was complete. In every
particular her story of her movements had proved right.</p>

<p>Green, arriving at the police station with an agitated and puzzled
nobleman and his solicitor, saw his chief for a few moments alone.</p>

<p>"She admits having handed over the jewels to Lola, but she won't say a
word beyond that," he said. "She's as obstinate as a mule. I have told
the Duke something of where we stand, and he has agreed to take the gems
back without letting her know. It was a tough job, but I got him to see
at last that the girl might be implicating herself. He says he's never
heard of Petrovska."<!-- Page 122 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span></p>

<p>"H'm." Foyle rubbed his chin vigorously. "I'll have a talk with the old
boy. See if you can get the Public Carriage Office to borrow us a
taxicab, and get Poole to drive it slowly up and down this street. If
she hails it when she goes out, well and good. If not, Bolt and you had
better follow her, and the cab will come after you so that you can use
it in emergency."</p>

<p>Green had done his work with the Duke and the lawyer with tact. Foyle
found his interview with them confined to evading questions that he had
no wish to answer. He dismissed them at last with the jewels in the
custody of the man of the law. Then he went straight to his prisoner.</p>

<p>"You can go," he said abruptly. "I shall ask you to be very careful,
however, Princess. If you are wise you will leave England at once."</p>

<p>"Why?" she asked, opening her blue eyes wide and gazing at him with
blank astonishment.</p>

<p>His voice became silky.</p>

<p>"Because, my dear lady," he said, "I feel that your career in England
may not be altogether without reproach. I shall try to find out a little
more about it, and if I get a chance, I warn you frankly, I shall have
you taken into custody. You are too mischievous to be allowed to run
around loose."</p>

<p>Her red lips parted in a scornful smile.</p>

<p>"Oh, you make me tired," she retorted. "Good-bye, Mr. Foyle."</p>

<p>"Pardon me," he said, and thrusting a couple of fingers into his
waistcoat pocket, fished out a piece of paper. "Do you know this
writing?"<!-- Page 123 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>

<p>She handed the piece of paper back to him with a shake of the head.</p>

<p>"No. I never saw it before," she retorted, and passed out.</p>

<p>But Heldon Foyle had her finger-prints.<!-- Page 124 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII"></a>CHAPTER XXII</h2>


<p>Sir Hilary Thornton lifted his coat-tails to the cheerful blaze as he
stood with his back to the fireplace. Heldon Foyle, with the book which
he was giving his nights and days to compiling on the desk in front of
him, sat bolt upright in his chair talking swiftly. He was giving an
account of the progress of the investigation. Now and again he ran a
well-manicured finger down the type-written index and turned the pages
over quickly to refer to a statement, a plan, or a photograph. Or he
would lift one of the speaking-tubes behind his desk and send for some
man who had been charged with some inquiry, to question him on his
report.</p>

<p>"These youngsters are all the same," he complained querulously. "They
will put flowers into their reports. It is always a beast of a job to
make 'em understand that we want a fact plain and prompt. They can do it
all right in the witness-box, but when they get a pen in their hand they
fancy they're budding Shakespeares. The old hands know better."</p>

<p>He passed from this outburst to particulars of what had happened. The
Assistant Commissioner listened gravely, now and again interpolating a
question or a suggestion. Foyle rapidly ran over the case, emphasising
his points with a tap of his finger on the pile of papers.</p>

<p>"We're progressing a little, though not so fast as<!-- Page 125 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span> I'd like. We know
that Grell is alive, that he is in touch with Ivan Abramovitch and Lola
Rachael&mdash;or the Princess Petrovska, as she calls herself. There is at
least one other man in it&mdash;probably more. It's fairly certain that Grell
knows who killed Harry Goldenburg even if he didn't do it himself.
Goldenburg was apparently dressed in Grell's clothes before he was
killed. It is clear now that the clothes were his own with Grell's
belongings put in the pockets. A Mexican dagger was used. That may be or
may not be of importance. Grell has travelled in Mexico. We have
eliminated Ivan and Sir Ralph Fairfield as the actual murderers. Nor do
the Princess Petrovska's finger-prints agree. I had Bolt take the
finger-prints of all the servants in the house, so that we are sure that
none of them actually committed the crime. All this narrows the
investigation. If we find Grell we are in a fair way to finding the
author of the murder."</p>

<p>Sir Hilary Thornton stroked his moustache doubtfully.</p>

<p>"That's all very well, Foyle, but Mr. Grell is hardly the sort of man to
commit murder. I gather that your suspicions point to him. Besides,
where is the motive?"</p>

<p>"Every man is the sort of man to commit murder," retorted the
superintendent quickly. "You can't class assassins. All murders must be
looked upon as problems in psychology. Mind you, I don't say that Grell
did have a hand in this murder. I am merely summing up the cold facts.
Why should he disappear? Why should he mix himself up with the shady
crew he is with&mdash;people who have twice tried to murder me, and who
knocked out and kidnapped Waverley? If we find him,<!-- Page 126 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span> we shall find the
murderer. That's why I wanted the description of Goldenburg sent out. It
makes work&mdash;I've got two men out of town now working on statements made
at Plymouth and Nottingham, which I feel sure will have no result, but
it gives us a sporting chance to nail him if he tries to leave the
country. Another line we're looking after is money. He's failed with
Fairfield. Lola had a try with Lady Eileen Meredith, who handed over her
jewels. We stepped in, bagged 'em, and gave 'em back to the Duke of
Burghley. All this means he'll have to make some desperate try for cash
soon."</p>

<p>"In fact it's check," commented Sir Hilary, who was something of a
chess-player. "Now you're man&#339;uvring for checkmate."</p>

<p>"Precisely," said Foyle. "I've been trying, too, to get hold of
something about Goldenburg. Neither we nor the American police have yet
been able to connect him up with Grell. We're still trying, though.
Sooner or later we shall get hold of something. And there's Lola. If we
could have got Wills to identify her as the veiled woman, we should have
had a very good excuse for arresting her in spite of her alibi. She's
the sort of woman who would prepare an alibi. We've not got any proof
that she knew Goldenburg. That's our great difficulty now&mdash;to link up
the various persons and find how they've been associated with each other
before. There's one thing, sir. I've managed to get the inquest
adjourned for a month, so we shan't have to make any premature
disclosures in evidence. The newspapers are still hanging about. They
got wind that something was happening at Malchester Row, and<!-- Page 127 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span> there were
a dozen or more men waiting for me when I came out, I told 'em that we'd
been trying to identify a woman and had failed. They'd have known that
anyway. They promised to be discreet. They're good chaps. It isn't like
the old days. There was one man&mdash;Winters his name was&mdash;who came up to
the Yard to see me once. He was told I was at Vine Street. He went down
there and was told I hadn't been there.</p>

<p>"'Here's a piece of luck,' he says to himself, and went back to his
office. There he wrote up a couple of columns telling how the whole of
the C.I.D. had lost trace of me. I came out of Bow Street, where I'd
been giving evidence in a case, to see a big contents-bill staring me in
the face&mdash;</p>

<p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0.1em;">FAMOUS</p>
<p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0.1em; margin-top: 0.1em;">DETECTIVE</p>
<p style="text-align: center; margin-top: 0.1em;">VANISHES</p>

<p>"Before I could buy a paper, another newspaper chap comes along. He
stared at me as if I was a ghost.</p>

<p>"'Hello!' he says. 'Don't you know you're lost? Every pressman in London
is looking for you.'</p>

<p>"'Am I?' says I. 'How?'</p>

<p>"Then it all came out. Since then I have been very careful in dealing
with newspaper men."</p>

<p>Sir Hilary laughed and nodded. "Is there anything more?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes." Foyle had grown grave once more. "I handed over the cipher that
we found at Grave Street to Jones, to see if he could make anything out
of it.<!-- Page 128 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span> He's an expert at these kind of puzzles. Well, he's just
reported that the thing is simple as it stands though in other
circumstances it might be difficult. The translation runs&mdash;</p>

<p>"This will be the best method of communicating with E.&nbsp;M. if L. supplies
her with key. Her 'phone number 12845 Gerrard."<!-- Page 129 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXIII"></a>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>


<p>Unless a case is elucidated within a day or two of the commission of an
offence the first hot pursuit resolves itself into a dogged, wearisome
but untiring watchfulness on the part of the C.I.D. A case is never
abandoned while there remains a chance, however slight, of running a
criminal to earth. And even when the detectives, like hounds baffled at
a scent, are called off, there remains the gambler's element of luck.
Even if the man who had original charge of the case should be dead when
some new element re-opens an inquiry, the result of his work is always
available, stored away in the Registry at Scotland Yard. There are
statements, reports, conclusions&mdash;the case complete up to the moment he
left it. The precaution is a useful one. A death-bed confession may
implicate confederates, accomplices may quarrel, a jealous woman may
give information. There have been unsolved mysteries, but no man may say
when a crime is unsolvable.</p>

<p>Heldon Foyle had many avenues of information when it was a matter of
ordinary professional crime. The old catchword, "Honour among thieves,"
was one he had little reason to believe in. There was always a trickle
of information into headquarters by subterranean ways. The commonplaces
of crime were effectively looked after. Murders are the exception in
criminal investigation work, and while other crimes may be dealt with by
certain predetermined if elastic<!-- Page 130 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span> rules, homicide had to be considered
differently. Yet Foyle had cause to think that there might be little
harm in setting to work the underground agencies which at first sight
seemed to have little enough in common with the mystery of the rich
Robert Grell. These spies and informers would try to cheat and trick
him. Some of them might succeed. It would cost money, but money that
might not be wasted.</p>

<p>Four of the five chief detective-inspectors who form the general staff
of the C.I.D. were in the room, among them Wagnell, who had passed a
quarter of a century in the East End and knew the lower grades of
"crooks" thoroughly, collectively, and individually.</p>

<p>Foyle shut the door.</p>

<p>"I wish some of you would pass the word among our people that we will
pay pretty handsomely for any one who puts us on to the gang mixed up in
this Grell business. Word it differently to that. You'll know how to put
it. You might get hold of Sheeny Foster, Wagnell, or Poodle Murphy, or
Buck Taylor. They may be able to nose out something."</p>

<p>"Buck was sent up for six months for jumping on his wife," said Wagnell.
"I haven't seen Sheeny lately, but I'll try to get hold of him, and I'll
have the word passed along."</p>

<p>So, having made the first step in enlisting a new and formidable force
of guerillas on the side of the law, Foyle went back to his office to
revolve the problem in his brain once more.</p>

<p>His thoughts wandered to Sir Ralph Fairfield. Here was a man whose
services would be invaluable if he could be persuaded to help. Grell
knew him;<!-- Page 131 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span> trusted him. Foyle was a man who never neglected the remotest
chances. He deemed it worth trying. True, so far as their encounters
were concerned, Fairfield had not been encouraging. He would probably
need delicate handling. Foyle wrote a note, scrutinised it rapidly, and,
going out, gave it to a clerk to be sent at once by special messenger.</p>

<p>"Mr. Heldon Foyle presents his compliments to Sir Ralph Fairfield and
would be obliged if he could see him at his office at six o'clock this
evening, or failing that, by an early appointment, on a matter of urgent
importance."</p>

<p>That was all it said: Foyle never wasted a word.</p>

<p>At five minutes past six that evening, Sir Ralph Fairfield was
announced. He ignored the offer of a chair which was made by the
superintendent, and stood with stony face a few paces from the door.
Foyle was too wise to offer his hand. He knew it would not be accepted.
He nodded affably.</p>

<p>"Good evening, Sir Ralph. I was hoping you would come. I would not have
troubled you but that I felt you would like to know how we are getting
on. You were a friend of Mr. Grell's."</p>

<p>"Well?" said Sir Ralph frigidly. "I am here, Mr. Foyle. Will you let me
know what you want to say and have done with it?"</p>

<p>His manner was entirely antagonistic. There was still a lingering fear
of arrest in his mind, but his attitude was in the main caused by the
fact that he believed he had been suspected by the other. The
superintendent partly guessed what was passing in his mind.<!-- Page 132 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span></p>

<p>"I want your word first, Sir Ralph, that what I tell you shall not be
spoken of by you to any living soul," he said. "Then I will tell you
frankly and openly the whole history of our investigation, and you can
decide whether you will help us or not. No&mdash;wait a moment. I know how
loyal a friend you were of Robert Grell's, and it's in the light of
that, that I am going to trust you. He is not dead. He is in hiding. It
is for you to say whether you will help us to find him. If he is
innocent he has nothing to fear."</p>

<p>He was watching the other closely while he sprung the fact that Grell
was alive upon him. He wanted to know whether it was really a surprise,
whether in spite of the vigilance of the C.I.D. men Grell or his
companions had managed to communicate with Fairfield. The baronet had
opened his mouth to speak. A flicker of colour came and went in his pale
cheeks, and he fingered his stick nervously. Then his jaw set, and he
strode to where the superintendent was sitting and clutched him tightly
by the arm.</p>

<p>"What's all this?" he demanded hoarsely. "Do you mean to say Grell is
not dead?"</p>

<p>"As far as I know he is as alive as you or I at this present minute,"
said Foyle. "If you want to hear about it all, give me your word and sit
down. You're hurting my arm."</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon," said the baronet mechanically, and, stepping back,
seated himself in a big arm-chair that flanked the desk. He passed his
hand in a dazed fashion across his forehead and his composure came back
to him. Staggering, incredible as the state<!-- Page 133 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>ment seemed, there was that
in Foyle's quiet tones that gave it the stamp of truth.</p>

<p>"Of course, I'll give you my word," he said.</p>

<p>Foyle was satisfied that the baronet knew nothing. There was a deeper
policy behind the pledge he had exacted than that of preventing a
leakage of confidence. Fairfield would not go behind his word. In that
the superintendent had judged him accurately. But the pledge would also
tie his hands should Grell or his companions eventually manage to
communicate with him. Even if he decided not to help the police, he
would find it difficult, without going behind his word, to assist the
missing explorer.</p>

<p>From the beginning he traced the trend of the investigation, Fairfield
leaning forward and listening attentively, his lips tight pressed. As
Foyle brought out the points, the baronet now and again jerked his head
in understanding. The detective slurred nothing, not even the accusation
and resolve of the Lady Eileen Meredith. The baronet choked a little.</p>

<p>"You think she really meant to kill me?" He waved his hand impatiently
as Foyle nodded. "Never mind that. Go on. Go on."</p>

<p>Foyle finished his recapitulation. Sir Ralph's eyes were fixed on a
"Vanity Fair" cartoon of the Commissioner of Police hanging framed on
the wall. He was trying to readjust his thoughts. From a man who
believed himself under deadly suspicion he had suddenly become a
confidant of Scotland Yard. He had been released of all fear for
himself. And Bob Grell was alive after all; that, he reflected, was the
queer thing. What did it mean? Where was the<!-- Page 134 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span> reason for this
extraordinary tangle of complications? Grell always was deep, but, so
far as his friend knew, he was a man strictly honourable. How had he
come to be involved in an affair that looked so black against him? There
was Eileen to be considered too. In spite of himself, he could readily
believe the story of the pistol. She had believed him guilty of the
murder. Her mood when last he saw her had been that of a woman who would
stoop to anything to compass her vengeance. But she knew he was not
guilty now. That might make a difference to his course of action. Should
he throw in his lot with Foyle and assist in bringing Grell within the
reach of the law?</p>

<p>"What do you say, Sir Ralph? Will you help us?"</p>

<p>Foyle's suave voice broke in upon the thread of his thoughts.</p>

<p>He shook himself a little and met the detective's steady gaze.</p>

<p>"If I do, will it mean that you will arrest Grell for murder?"</p>

<p>The superintendent caressed his chin and hesitated a little before
replying.</p>

<p>"I have been quite open with you, Sir Ralph. I don't know. As things are
at present, it looks uncommonly as though he had a hand in it. He is the
only person who can clear himself. While he remains in hiding everything
looks black against him. We have managed to keep things quiet until the
resumption of the inquest. When that takes place we shall not be able to
maintain the confusion of identity. With things as they stand, the jury
are practically certain<!-- Page 135 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span> to return a verdict of murder against him. If
he is not guilty, his best chance is for us to find him. Understand me,
Sir Ralph. If he is innocent you are doing him no service by refraining
from helping us. Every day makes things blacker. If he is guilty&mdash;well,
it is for you to judge whether you will shield a murderer even if he is
your friend."</p>

<p>To another person, Foyle would have used another method of persuasion,
talking more but saying less. He had staked much on his estimate of the
baronet's character, and awaited his reply with an anxiety of which his
face gave no trace. Very rare were the occasions on which he had told so
much of an unfinished investigation to another person, and that person
not an official of Scotland Yard. Often he had feigned to open his heart
with the same object&mdash;to win confidence by apparent confidence. The
difference now was that he had given the facts without concealment or
suppression.</p>

<p>Fairfield fingered his watch-chain, and the big office clock loudly
ticked five minutes away.</p>

<p>"I will assist you as far as I can, but you must allow me to decide when
to remain neutral," he said at last.</p>

<p>"Agreed," said Foyle, and the two shook hands on the bargain.<!-- Page 136 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXIV"></a>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>


<p>Dutch Fred changed his seat to one less conspicuous and farther up the
tramcar. He felt that his luck was dead out, that life was a blank. And
that Heldon Foyle of all men should have chosen that particular moment
to board that particular tramcar had, as Fred would have expressed it,
"absolutely put the lid on." Fred knew very well how to circumvent the
precaution taken by order of the police that public vehicles should have
the back of the seats filled in to prevent pocket-picking. Instead of
sitting behind a victim, one sat by his side, with a "stall" behind to
pass the plunder to. A "dip" of class&mdash;and Dutch Fred was an
acknowledged master&mdash;never keeps his plunder on him for a single second
longer than necessary. But with Foyle on the car it was too expensive to
operate, especially single-handed. Therefore, Fred felt the world a
dreary place.</p>

<p>He had boarded the car alone and without thought of plunder. Had it been
in professional hours, he would have had at least one "stall"&mdash;perhaps
two&mdash;with him. As chance would have it, a portly business man, with a
massive gold chain spanning his ample waist, had seated himself next the
operator. And Fred had decided that the watch on the end of the cable
was worth risking an experiment upon. Besides, the appearance of
prosperity of the "mug" spoke of a possible "leather" stuffed with
banknotes. Decidedly,<!-- Page 137 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span> even in the absence of a "stall," it was worth
chancing. And then Foyle got on and spoilt it all. If any one on the
tramcar lost anything he would know who to blame.</p>

<p>For Heldon Foyle had spoiled one of the greatest coups that ever a crook
had been on the verge of bringing off. Fred, immaculately clad, and with
irreproachable references, had approached Greenfields, the Bond Street
jewellers, with a formula for manufacturing gold. He had discovered the
philosopher's stone. "Of course, I don't want you to go into this until
I've proved that it can actually be done," he said airily. "See there. I
made that handful of gold-dust myself. You test it, and see that it's
all right. Now, I'll sell you the secret of making that for &pound;100,000. I
don't want the money till I've given you a demonstration."</p>

<p>So an arrangement was fixed up. The jewellers, with a faith that long
experience had not destroyed, believed in Fred. Nevertheless, they took
the precaution of calling in Foyle, then unknown to Fred save by name.
In a little room in Clerkenwell the experiment took place. With
ingenious candour, Fred prepared a crucible in front of his select
audience after the various ingredients had been submitted to strict
examination. Then he placed it on the fire, and stirred the contents
occasionally. At last the process was finished, and at the bottom of the
crucible was found a teaspoonful of undoubted gold-dust. Then, while
Fred, with a broad smile of satisfaction, awaited comment, the
detective, who had noted the strange fact that he had kept his gloves on
while stirring the crucible, stepped up to him and deftly whipped one
off. In the fingers were traces<!-- Page 138 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span> of gold-dust&mdash;enough to convict Fred
and get him three years at the Old Bailey.</p>

<p>Out of the corner of his eyes, Fred watched the detective presently
stand up and pass along the deck of the car towards him. The operator's
face was bland, and he smiled with the consciousness of one who has
nothing to hide as the superintendent sat down beside him.</p>

<p>"Hello, Mr. Foyle! I am glad to see you," he said, with a heartiness
that he knew did not deceive the other. "It's a long time since we met."</p>

<p>The detective returned the greeting with a cheerfulness that was
entirely unassumed.</p>

<p>"It's a piece of luck meeting you, Freddy," he went on. "But there, I
always was lucky. You're just the man in the wide world I've been
wanting to see."</p>

<p>"What's on?" growled Freddy, with quick suspicion.</p>

<p>"Oh, you're all right," the detective reassured him. "I want you to help
me. Let's get off at the next stopping-place and have a drink."</p>

<p>His fears allayed, Freddy followed the detective off the car. They were
professional enemies, it was true, but as a rule their relations were
amicable. It was policy on both sides.</p>

<p>In the saloon bar of an adjacent public-house, Freddy unburdened himself
fully and frankly while he sipped the mixed vermuth.</p>

<p>"I'm glad you struck me&mdash;on my word I am," he said earnestly, while his
active wits were wondering what the detective wanted. "That bloke was
carrying a red clock, and, though I was going for it, I had a feeling I
should get into trouble. If you'd been a minute or two later,
you'd&mdash;&mdash;"<!-- Page 139 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why talk of these unpleasant things, Freddy?" said Foyle, with a
deprecatory wave of the hand. "You know how I'd hate to have to do
anything to disturb your peace of mind." He drew him to a secluded
corner of the lounge. "Come over here. Now, listen. Do you know
Goldenburg or any of his pals?"</p>

<p>Freddy started a little, and looked meditatively at the tips of his
well-polished boots.</p>

<p>"The chap that did in Grell. I knew him a bit," he said cautiously. "He
was in a different line, you know. Mostly works alone, too. I can't say
that I know much about him. There's Charlie Eden, he was in with him
once&mdash;I guess he's in town. And Red Ike, he knew him, too. Perhaps
there's some more of the boys who had some does with him. But he always
was a bit above us common crooks. I only went for big game once,"&mdash;his
gaze lingered on Foyle's ring,&mdash;"and then it didn't come off."</p>

<p>"Never mind about Eden. You keep your eyes skinned for Red Ike, or any
one else that knew Harry, and give me the office. It'll be worth your
while. You can come to me if you're hard up. Have a shot at &mdash;&mdash; and
---- and &mdash;&mdash;" He named several public-houses which are known rendezvous
for crooks of all classes. "You see what you can pick up. And if ever
you're in trouble, you'll know the wife and kid will be looked after."</p>

<p>Freddy grinned cynically to hide a real appreciation. He knew that Foyle
would do as he said. And in the criminal profession, however big the
makings, there is very rarely anything like thrift. For a man who at any
time might find himself doing five years, it was<!-- Page 140 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span> something to know that
those left outside were in no danger of the workhouse. For even "crooks"
have human instincts at times.</p>

<p>"That's all right, Mr. Foyle," said Freddy. "What you say goes. Who'll I
ask for if you're not at your office?"</p>

<p>"You can talk to Mr. Green."</p>

<p>"Right oh."</p>

<p>Freddy swung out into the dusk, whistling, for he had an assignment with
his "stalls" outside one of the big theatres. Foyle waited a few moments
to let him get clear, and himself stepped into the street.</p>

<p>To the surprise and disgust of the rest of the "mob," Freddy early
relinquished the evening's expedition, although his deft fingers had
captured no more than a silver watch (hung deceptively on a gold chain,
which he had left hanging), a woman's purse containing fifteen shillings
in silver, and a pocket-book inside which were half-a-dozen letters. It
was a poor hand, and Micky O'Brady, who was one of the "stalls," frankly
expressed his disgust.</p>

<p>"What's the use of chucking it at this time o' night? It ain't nine
o'clock yet. There's the lifts at the Tube that we haven't worked for
weeks. 'Struth; what did you want to fetch us out for at all? The stuff
you've got won't buy drinks."</p>

<p>Freddy's lower jaw jutted out dangerously. He was a small man, but he
had a hair-trigger temper. He always made a point to be unquestioned
boss of his gang. Discipline had to be maintained at all costs.</p>

<p>"See here, Micky," he said tensely. "I've had enough to-night, and I'm
going to give it a rest. So<!-- Page 141 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span> you'd better shut your face. I'm the man
who's got the say, so here. You just bite on that."</p>

<p>Micky, an Irish Cockney who had never been nearer Ireland than a
professional visit to the Isle of Man, clenched his fists with an oath.
He was a recent ally, and had not fully learned his position in Freddy's
scheme of things. In just two minutes, he was sitting gasping on the
pavement, trying to regain his wits after a tremendous punch in the
solar plexus, while his fellow "stall" was explaining to a constable
that it was all an accident, and Freddy had quietly melted away in the
direction of the Tube station.</p>

<p>The pickpocket never strained his luck, wherein he differed from the
lower grade professors of his art. Common sense and superstition were
both factors in his decision to suspend operations. He might as well
spend his time, he decided, in trying to carry out Foyle's instructions.
His intention took him to three public-houses as far apart as Islington,
Blackfriars, and Whitechapel; at the latter place, in an ornate saloon
bristling with gilt and glittering with mirrors, he found the man he
wanted.</p>

<p>Leaning across the bar, exchanging sallies with a giggling barmaid, was
a lean, sallow-complexioned man, whose rusty, reddish brown hair was
sufficient justification for his nickname.</p>

<p>"Hello, Ike," said the newcomer, adjusting himself to a high stool.
"How's things?"</p>

<p>"Hello, Dutch. Thought you got stuck the other side of the town. What
are you going to have?"</p>

<p>Over the drinks they talked for a little on a variety of subjects&mdash;the
weather, politics, trade&mdash;while the bar<!-- Page 142 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>maid remained within hearing.
Both were craftsmen in their particular line, and they spoke as equal to
equal. Ike had made a specialty of getting cheque signatures for a
little clique of clever forgers, and had his own ways of getting rid of
his confederates' ingenuity. Nor was he above working side-lines if they
promised profit, and in that respect, at least, he resembled Dutch Fred.
His abilities in many directions had been recognised by Harry
Goldenburg. It was not till they had gone over to a little table in a
remote corner that Dutch Fred broached Goldenburg's name, in a tentative
reference to the murder in Grosvenor Gardens.</p>

<p>"Funny thing you should speak about that," commented Ike, glancing
casually about to make certain that no one was within earshot. "I hear
that there's piles of stuff in that house, and there's only a butler and
a man named Lomont, who was Grell's secretary, living there now to look
after things. It would be easy to do a bust there."</p>

<p>Fred's pulses jumped a little faster as he toyed with his glass. He knew
something of Red Ike's methods, and felt certain that some proposal was
coming. He could see the gratitude of Foyle taking some tangible form if
he were able to bring this off. He had no scruples. Even if Ike
suspected treachery after the event&mdash;well, he could look after himself.</p>

<p>"I don't know," he said, shaking his head doubtfully. "It isn't like a
lonely suburban street."</p>

<p>Ike grinned.</p>

<p>"I'm not a mug, am I? What do you say to walking in the front door,
opening it with a key, and with the<!-- Page 143 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span> keys of the rest of the house in my
'sky'? All I want is a straight man to keep doggo."</p>

<p>"Criminy! Have you got the twirls?" he gasped. "Where did you get 'em?"</p>

<p>"Never mind where they came from. I've got 'em. That's enough. More than
that, I've got a lay-out of the house all marked out on paper, with
every bit of stuff marked out where it ought to be. It's as easy as
falling off a log."</p>

<p>"Am I in it?" demanded Freddy.</p>

<p>"Why should I be telling you if you wasn't? You keep doggo outside if
you like."</p>

<p>More drinks were ordered, and Freddy came to business.</p>

<p>"What do I get?"</p>

<p>Ike let his chin rest meditatively on his slim fingers.</p>

<p>"Let's see. I cut in for a third, and I shall do all the work. I'll give
you a quarter of that third. You won't have anything to do, except give
me the office if anything goes wrong."</p>

<p>"'Struth!" Freddy was more hurt than indignant. "You aren't going to Jew
me down like that. Who else is in it?"</p>

<p>"Never mind who else is in it. I give you first chance, as a pal. You
can take it or leave it."</p>

<p>"Right, I'm on," agreed Freddy.<!-- Page 144 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXV" id="CHAPTER_XXV"></a>CHAPTER XXV</h2>


<p>The compact between Heldon Foyle and Sir Ralph Fairfield had begun to
bear fruit. For three days an advertisement had appeared in the personal
column of the <i>Daily Wire</i>&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"Will R.&nbsp;G. communicate with R.&nbsp;F. Very anxious."</p></blockquote>

<p>Much thought had gone to the wording of the line. If Grell or any of his
companions noticed it, Foyle felt certain that in some way or other an
attempt would be made to get in touch with the baronet. He was fairly
confident that the missing man needed money. He would probably not
question how Fairfield knew that he was alive. If he rose to the bait
there would be a catch of some sort. Whether Grell was the murderer or
not, he held the key to the heart of the mystery. The superintendent
emphasised this in a talk with Fairfield.</p>

<p>"It's a fair ruse. We're pretty certain he's hiding somewhere in London,
and it's a big field unless we've got a starting-point. That's our
trouble&mdash;finding a starting-point. In detective stories the hero always
hits on it unerringly at once. There was one yarn in which the scratches
on the back of a watch gave the clue to the temperament and history of
its possessor. Now, that watch might have been borrowed or bought
second-hand, or lost and restored at some time, and<!-- Page 145 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span> the marks made by
any one but its owner. That kind of subtlety is all right in print, but
in real life it would put you on a false track in nineteen out of twenty
cases. In ninety cases out of a hundred the obvious solution is the
right one. In an investigation there may be coincidences of
circumstantial evidence pointing in the wrong direction. But when you
get first one coincidence, then a second, a third, and a fourth, you can
be fairly sure you're on the right track. You don't add proof together.
You multiply it. See here."</p>

<p>He drew a piece of paper towards him and rapidly scribbled upon it.</p>

<table border="0" summary="probability chart">
<tr><td>One coincidence</td><td style="text-align: justify;">. . . . .</td><td>=</td><td>0</td></tr>
<tr><td>Two coincidences</td><td style="text-align: justify;">. . . . .</td><td>=</td><td>2</td></tr>
<tr><td>Three coincidences</td><td style="text-align: justify;">. . . . .</td><td>=</td><td>6</td></tr>
<tr><td>Four coincidences</td><td style="text-align: justify;">. . . . .</td><td>=</td><td>24</td></tr>
<tr><td>Five coincidences</td><td style="text-align: justify;">. . . . .</td><td>=</td><td>120</td></tr>
</table>

<p>"That's the kind of thing in terms of arithmetic. Now look at the parts
in relation to each other. Grell leaves the club and gets you to lie
about his absence. Coincidence number one. A man astonishingly like him
is murdered in his study a short time afterwards. Coincidence number
two. He is apparently dressed in Grell's clothes and has Grell's
belongings in his pockets. Coincidence number three. Both Grell and his
valet, Ivan Abramovitch, disappear. Coincidence number four. Ivan is
found with the pearl necklace on him. Coincidence number five. Grell
writes you a note, which I stole from you. Coincidence number six. You
follow me? I could go on with other proofs. Grell <i>must</i><!-- Page 146 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span> know who
committed this murder, and if we get hold of him we shall know."</p>

<p>"I see the point," confessed Fairfield. "All the same, I don't believe,
even if he knows as you say, that he had a hand in it. This may be the
hundreth case, you know, and there may be some satisfactory explanation
of his actions."</p>

<p>"I quite agree. Even cumulative proof may be destroyed. I can guess what
you are half thinking. You believe that I've fastened my suspicions on
Grell, and that I'm determined to go through with it right or wrong.
That's a common mistake people fall into in regard to police functions.
In fact, it doesn't matter a bit to a police official whether he gets a
conviction or not&mdash;unless, of course, he neglects an important piece of
proof through gross carelessness. All he has to do is to solve a problem
and to place his answer before a magistrate, and then a judge and jury
to decide whether he's right or wrong. No one but a fool would attempt
to bolster up a wrong answer. In this case, too, you must remember that
there are finger-prints. They cannot lie. If we get the right man&mdash;Grell
or any one else&mdash;there will be no question of doubt."</p>

<p>Fairfield tapped a cigarette on the back of his left hand and rose.</p>

<p>"Well, even if you do draw Grell with that advertisement, I doubt if
you'll get anything from him if he doesn't want to talk. I know the man,
and he's hard to beat out of any decision that he makes up his mind to,
as hard"&mdash;he bowed smilingly to the detective&mdash;"as you would be."<!-- Page 147 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span></p>

<p>"Thank you. If it were a question of Grell against Foyle I might have to
go under. But it isn't. Behind me is the C.I.D., behind that the whole
force, behind that the Home Secretary, and behind him the State. So you
see the odds are on my side."</p>

<p>A jerky buzz at the telephone behind the superintendent's desk
interrupted any reply that Fairfield might have made. With a muttered
"Good-day" the baronet moved across the carpeted floor out of the room.
As he closed the door Foyle put the receiver to his ear.</p>

<p>"Hello! Hello!... Yes, this is Foyle speaking. Oh yes, I know.... No,
you'd better not tell me over the telephone. You can't come here.
Somebody who knows you might see you.... Is it important?... All right.
You'd better come to Lyon's tea-place in the Strand&mdash;the one nearest
Trafalgar Square. I'll get Mr. Green to go along and have a talk with
you. Good-bye."</p>

<p>Rubbing his hands together thoughtfully, the superintendent sent for
Green. In a few moments the big figure of the chief inspector loomed in
the doorway.</p>

<p>"Dutch Fred thinks he's got hold of something," opened Foyle abruptly.
"I've told him to meet you at Lyon's in the Strand. I think he's all
right, but don't let him have any money until you've tested his yarn."</p>

<p>"Very good, sir," said Green. "I'll look into it."</p>

<p>As he left Foyle bent over his desk and, with the concentration that was
one of his distinguishing traits, busied himself in a series of reports
on a coining raid in Kensington, sent up to him by those concerned for<!-- Page 148 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
his perusal. He had a theory that the efficiency of the battalion of
detectives under him was not lessened by making his men tell him exactly
how they were performing their work, both verbally and in writing. "You
may have brains, you may have intuition, you may have courage, but
you'll never make a good detective without system," he sometimes told
young officers when they joined the staff of the C.I.D. There were
things, of course, that could not be put in writing, but Foyle never
invited his subordinates to act against the law. Such things have to be
done at a man's own discretion without official sanction.</p>

<p>It was less than an hour when the chief inspector returned, portentously
grave.</p>

<p>"Well?" demanded Foyle.</p>

<p>"The real goods," said Green, who was obviously feeling pleased with
himself. "Your long shot has come off. They're falling short of money,
for they've put Red Ike up to break into Grell's house and steal all the
stuff in sight. Ike has asked Fred to give him a hand."</p>

<p>A low whistle came from Foyle's lips. Why hadn't he thought of this?
Discreetly done, with the help of a confederate&mdash;and apparently Grell
had no lack of confederates&mdash;it would get over the money difficulty
quite simply.</p>

<p>"Sit down, Green. Let's hear all about it," he said, diving into his
pocket for the inevitable cigar.</p>

<p>"It's all fixed up. Ike walks into the place with Grell's keys at eight
o'clock to-night, while Freddy keeps watch outside&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And some one keeps an eye on Freddy, if I'm any judge. Go on. Who put
Ike up to it?"<!-- Page 149 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span></p>

<p>"He won't say. He's as tight as a drum about all that, according to
Freddy. When we arrest him we must get something out of him."</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Foyle slowly. "Ike's a queer bird. Dutch Fred will
need to look after himself if ever he knows who gave the game away. Well
now, let's fix up things. Is any one keeping an eye on the place for
Ike?"</p>

<p>"Freddy's supposed to be there."</p>

<p>"And I guess that they've found out that Lomont and Wills will be out of
the house to-night. You might find out for sure, Green. 'Phone Lomont,
but don't stop 'em if they've made arrangements. It would simplify
matters if we could get one or two of our own men in the house. We
daren't do that, though."</p>

<p>"Why not? If Freddy's keeping watch&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's all right. It isn't Freddy I'm afraid of. There'll be some one
else there. The people who put this game up are not going to trust a
couple of crooks entirely. I think I'll take a stroll out that way
myself about seven o'clock. We'd better have the place surrounded. I'll
send for a section map of that part."</p>

<p>A clerk brought the map, and Foyle's fingers described a wide, irregular
circle, now and again halting at one spot where he wished a man to be
placed.</p>

<p>"That ought to do," said the superintendent when Green had finished
taking a note of the various points. "Pick out some good men, though I
don't suppose they will have much to do. It's only a measure of
precaution. You'd better be on hand yourself about half-past seven. If
all goes well we shall get bigger game than Ike."<!-- Page 150 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXVI"></a>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>


<p>Within the invisible cordon that Foyle had drawn about Grell's house in
Grosvenor Gardens, Dutch Fred loitered, his keen, ferret eyes wandering
alertly over passers-by. Misgivings had assailed him during a vigil that
had lasted several hours. It was all very well to be "in with" the
police; but suppose their plans miscarried? Suppose Red Ike and his
unknown friends got to know that the "double cross" was being put on
them? Fred fingered a heavy knuckle-duster in his pocket nervously. Man
to man, he was not afraid of Ike, but there were his friends.</p>

<p>The tall straight figure of Heldon Foyle, with coat collar turned high
up, had passed him once without sign of recognition and vanished in the
enveloping shadow of the slight fog that confused the night. Yet, though
the superintendent had apparently paid no heed, he was entirely alert,
and he had not failed to observe Freddy. What he wanted was to see who
else was in the street. He returned by a detour to an hotel in the
Buckingham Palace Road, outside which a big motor-car was at rest, with
a fairly complete mental picture of three people who might be possible
spies among those he had passed.</p>

<p>The thickening fog was both an advantage and a disadvantage to the
detectives&mdash;an advantage because it would force any person watching on
behalf of Grell and his associates to keep within a reasonable distance<!-- Page 151 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
of the house if Ike was not to be lost sight of, and a disadvantage
because it would afford increased facilities for any one to slip away.</p>

<p>To Green, seated in the motor-car, Foyle commented on this fact.</p>

<p>"You'll have to have your breakdown rather closer to the house than we
thought," he said. "Give Ike a good chance inside. You've got the
duplicate key all right?"</p>

<p>"That's safe enough," answered Green, tapping his pocket. "If I don't
see you after we've bagged him I'd better charge him with housebreaking,
I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Certainly. Now get along. It's a quarter to eight."</p>

<p>The car moved silently forward and took the corner of Grosvenor Gardens.
Thirty paces beyond the spot where Dutch Freddy was lighting a cigarette
it came to a stop, while the chauffeur, dropping to the ground, rummaged
fiercely with the interior. Green leaned back in the shadow, his eyes
fixed on the steps leading to Grell's house. There was a sufficient air
of plausibility about the whole accident to impress any one but the most
suspicious.</p>

<p>Heldon Foyle had entered the hotel, for he did not care to run the risk
of frightening his quarry by showing himself again until it was
necessary. But he kept a vigilant eye on the clock. Promptly as the
hands touched ten minutes past eight he made his way once more to the
corner of Grosvenor Gardens. A labourer, with corduroy trousers tied
about the knee and a grimy, spotted blue handkerchief about his neck,
approached him with unlit pipe and a request for a match.<!-- Page 152 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span></p>

<p>"Red Ike's gone along," he said, as Foyle supplied him. "Nobody else has
been hanging round except Freddy. The constable on the beat passed along
just after Ike."</p>

<p>The match, was dropped in the gutter, and the superintendent, his face
set grimly, moved slowly on. The labourer crossed to the other side of
the road and followed. Foyle was quite near the house when Green walked
up, accompanied by his chauffeur, and made quickly up the steps. Shadowy
in the fog, the superintendent could see the dim outline of a
constable's uniform. The man was peering anxiously at the doorway
through which Green had gone.</p>

<p>"Well, my man," said Foyle sharply, "are you on duty here? Who are those
people who have just gone in there?"</p>

<p>The policeman gave a barely perceptible start, and then took a pace
forward.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I believe they have no right there. I must go and see," he said, but
was brought up with a jerk as Foyle's hand clutched his wrist. The
labourer who had wanted a light was coming across the road at a run and,
though a little puzzled, had seized the constable's other hand.</p>

<p>"No, you don't," said Foyle peremptorily. "When you masquerade as a
policeman again, my friend, make sure you have a letter of the right
division on your collar. This district is B, not M. I am a police
officer, and I shall arrest you on a charge of being concerned in an
attempt at housebreaking. You'd better not make a fuss. Come on,
Smithers. Let's get him into the car."</p>

<p>The prisoner made no resistance. He seemed dazed.<!-- Page 153 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span> Once in the car, the
detective took the precaution to handcuff him to his subordinate&mdash;right
wrist to the officer's left wrist&mdash;for he did not know how long the wait
for Green might be, and it seemed wisest not to run risks. Detectives
rarely handcuff their prisoners unless travelling. It is conspicuous and
unnecessary.</p>

<p>"Now we're more comfortable," said Foyle, sinking into the cushions of
the car. "If you want to give any explanation before I formally charge
you, you may. Only don't forget that anything you say may be used in
evidence against you."</p>

<p>"Is it an offence to go to a fancy-dress ball in a police officer's
uniform?" asked the prisoner. "Because if it is, I shall plead guilty."</p>

<p>"You can make that defence if you like&mdash;if you think it will be
believed," retorted Foyle. "It will be better for every one if you tell
the truth, though."</p>

<p>The man lapsed into a surly, sullen silence, and the superintendent
could feel that he was glaring at him in the darkness of the closed car.
The other detective looked through the window.</p>

<p>"Here comes Mr. Green, sir."</p>

<p>Arm in arm and in amicable converse with Ike, the chief
detective-inspector was approaching the car, with the chauffeur on the
other side. Ike, it appeared, had been run to earth in the dining-room,
and had surrendered at discretion. He had all the philosophy of the
habitual thief who knows when the game is up. He grinned a little when
he saw the handcuffed policeman in the car.</p>

<p>"Why, it's you, Mr. Smith! Didn't you think I could be trusted for fair
does over the stuff inside?<!-- Page 154 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span> You've fallen into it this time, and no
blooming error. Where's Fred?"</p>

<p>"Fred who?" queried Foyle. "Is there some one else in this job?"</p>

<p>But Red Ike was too old a bird to be deceived. Instinct, as well as
reason, told him that he had been betrayed, and the absence of Fred but
lent fuel to his suspicions.</p>

<p>"Aw&mdash;don't come it, Mr. Foyle," he said disgustedly, and added a
picturesque flow of language, elaborating the steps he would take to get
even with Dutch Fred when he had the opportunity. Not one of the
detectives interrupted him. The more he talked the better, for he might
drop something of value. Not until they drew up at the police station
did his eloquence desert him. The superintendent descended first and
gave a few instructions, while the <i>soi-disant</i> constable was taken to
the cells. Ike found himself escorted upstairs into the C.I.D. office.
Only Heldon Foyle and Green remained with him.</p>

<p>"Sit down and make yourself comfortable," said the superintendent
cheerfully. "We want to have a little talk with you, Ike. Would you like
a drink? Here, have a cigar."</p>

<p>Red Ike's swift wits were on the alert. Never before had he known this
kind of hospitality to be tendered in a police station to a man arrested
red-handed. And although suspicious, he was nevertheless flattered. All
criminals, whether at the top or bottom of their profession, are beset
by vanity.</p>

<p>"A little out of your usual line this," went on Foyle, watching his man
intently. "As neat a job as ever<!-- Page 155 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span> was spoiled by accident. Now you know,
as well as I do, that we can't force you to talk. But it'll help us a
bit if you tell us who you got those keys from, for instance."</p>

<p>The office was small and plainly furnished, and Ike stared into the fire
as he sipped his whisky, with placid face. That the interview was to be
the English equivalent of the third degree, he knew not. There would be
no bullying, only coaxing. Foyle was in a position where consummate tact
was needed if he was to extract anything from the prisoner. He dared
neither threaten nor promise. However helpful Ike might be, he would
still have to submit the issue of guilt and punishment to a judge and
jury. Ike, unlike Dutch Fred, had no relations, and if he had it was
doubtful if any promise of consideration for them would move him.</p>

<p>"It's no good, Mr. Foyle," said Ike. "The only man that was in this with
me was Dutch Fred. You'd better go and get him, because I shall tell all
about it in court. He gave me the keys."</p>

<p>"Don't be a fool, Ike," interposed Green.</p>

<p>The prisoner glanced from one to the other with cunning, twinkling eyes.
He was too wary to say anything that may be used as evidence.</p>

<p>"I guess that it isn't bursting into the place that's put you two to
work," he said. "You want to know something. If I could help you I
s'pose you'd drop this case?"</p>

<p>Heldon Foyle shook his head resolutely.</p>

<p>"You know we can't do that in a case of felony. Mr. Green will put in a
good word for you at the trial. That's the farthest we can go to."<!-- Page 156 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span></p>

<p>Ike put down his empty glass. He believed he held the whip hand&mdash;that he
had much to gain and nothing to lose by holding out for better terms. It
was a false impression, though a natural one. Heldon Foyle had neither
the power nor the inclination to drive a bargain that would permit Ike
to go unscathed to renew his depredations on society.</p>

<p>"It's no good, guv'nor," said Ike. "If you want me to talk I'll do
it&mdash;if you'll let me go."</p>

<p>"Right." Foyle rose abruptly. "We'll let it go at that, Ike. You please
yourself, of course. Mr. Green, you'd better charge him now."</p>

<p>He had passed out of the door, and his footsteps were dying away when
Ike awoke to the fact that his attempt at bluff had failed. He raised
his voice. "Hi! Mr. Foyle! Don't go yet. I'll cough up what I know. Come
back."<!-- Page 157 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXVII"></a>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>


<p>A grim smile flickered under Chief Inspector Green's grey moustache as
Heldon Foyle stepped briskly back into the room and closed the door. Ike
met a stare of the superintendent's cold blue eyes squarely.</p>

<p>"You've got the bulge on me this time, guv'nor," he admitted ruefully.
"I give you best. You're welcome to all I know&mdash;though that isn't much."</p>

<p>Now that he was near attaining his end, Foyle had to steer a delicate
course. The law very rightly insists that there shall be neither threat
nor promise held out to any person who is accused of a crime. From the
moment a police officer has made up his mind to arrest a man, he must
not directly or indirectly induce a person to say anything that might
prove his guilt&mdash;and a warning of the possible consequences is insisted
upon even when a statement is volunteered. Otherwise admissions or
evidence so obtained are ignored, and there is trouble for the police
officer who obtained them. That is one of the reasons why detective work
in England demands perhaps nicer skill than in most other countries.</p>

<p>Green had pulled a fountain pen from his pocket and adjusted a couple of
sheets of official foolscap. Foyle remained standing.</p>

<p>"Don't let's have any misunderstanding," he said. "We're not making any
promises except that the court will know you helped us in another case.
If you choose to keep quiet we can't do a thing to you."</p>

<p>"I know all about that," said Ike, with a little shrug<!-- Page 158 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span> of his
shoulders. "You know I wouldn't squeal in an ordinary job. I'm no Dutch
Freddy to give my pals away. I don't owe the chap anything who put me up
to this. What do you want first?"</p>

<p>"Tell us all about it your own way. Where did you get the keys of the
house?"</p>

<p>"Off that chap you raked in along of me. I was sitting in a little game
of faro at a joint in the Commercial Road about a week ago, when this
tough pulls me out and puts it up to me. I didn't much like it, but the
chink who runs the show told me he was straight, and he offered me
half&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You told Freddy you were only getting a third," interposed Green.</p>

<p>"Did I?" Ike grinned cunningly. "It must have been a slip of the tongue.
Anyway, I said I'd chip in for half or nothing. He pow-wowed a bit, but
at last he gave in. Funny thing about it was he wouldn't hear of keeping
an eye open on the day we brought the job off. Said I must get a pal.
Yet here he turns up as large as life all the time."</p>

<p>The prisoner had hit on a point which had puzzled Foyle for a time, but
light had already flashed upon him. In the ordinary course of things, a
robbery at Grosvenor Gardens by two known criminal characters would not
of necessity be associated with the murder. The third man was taking no
chances of being identified as an associate.</p>

<p>"Anyway, I took the job on, and he handed me over the twirls and a
lay-out of the house. He didn't tell me who was behind him. And I didn't
ask too many questions. He called himself Mr. Smith, and we met<!-- Page 159 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span> once or
twice at the &mdash;&mdash;" He named a public-house in Leman Street, Whitechapel.
"That's where I was to have met him to-night with the stuff. Now you
know all I know."</p>

<p>"Not quite," said Foyle quietly. "What's the address of this
gambling-joint where you first met him?"</p>

<p>Ike shook his head. "Oh, play the game, guv'nor. You aren't going to
have that raided after what I've done for you?"</p>

<p>"We'll see," evaded Foyle. "Where is it?"</p>

<p>Reluctantly, Ike gave the address. Green held out a pen to him and
pointed to the bottom of the foolscap.</p>

<p>"Read that through and sign it if it's all right."</p>

<p>The man appended a dashing signature, and with a cheerful "Good night,
Mr. Foyle," was ushered by a chief detective-inspector down to the
charge-room. Heldon Foyle rested his elbows on the table and remained in
deep thought, immobile as a statue. He roused himself with a start as
Green returned.</p>

<p>"Both charged," said the other laconically. "The other chap refuses to
give any account of himself. Refuses even to give a name. Seems to be a
Yankee. I had his finger-prints taken. There was nothing on him to
identify him."</p>

<p>"Yankee, eh?" repeated Foyle. "So is Grell. There won't be any one in
the finger-print department at this time of night. We'll go along and
have a search by ourselves, I think. If we've not got him there,
Pinkerton of the U.&nbsp;S. National Detective Agency is staying at the
Cecil. We'll get him to have a look over our man and say whether he
recognises him."</p>

<p>"Very good, sir. There's one other thing. When<!-- Page 160 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span> I searched this man I
found this. I don't know if you can make anything out of it. I can't."</p>

<p>He handed across an envelope already torn open, addressed to "The
Advertisement Dept., The <i>Daily Wire</i>." Within were two plain sheets of
notepaper and a postal order. On one was written: "Dear Sir, please
insert the enclosed advts. in the personal column of your next
issue.&mdash;John Jones." On the other were two advertisements&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"R.F. You are closely watched. Don't forget 2315. Don't forget
2315. G.</p>

<p>"E. &pound;27.14.5. To-morrow. B."</p></blockquote>

<p>"Very curious," commented Foyle. "Copy them out carefully and have 'em
sent to the paper. They can't do any harm. Now let's get along."</p>

<p>The fog hung heavy over a muffled world as they walked down Victoria
Street. Green, whose wits were a trifle less supple than those of his
chief when imagination was required, put a question. Foyle answered
absently. The mysterious advertisements were not altogether mysterious
to him. He recalled the cipher that had been found at Grave Street, and
decided that there was at least room for hope in that direction.
Besides, there was at least one man now in custody who knew something of
the mystery, and, even if he kept his lips locked indefinitely, there
was a probable chance of a new line of inquiry opening when his identity
was discovered. And even if finger-prints and Pinkerton failed to
resolve that, there was still the resource of the newspapers. With a
photograph scattered far and wide, the odds were in favour of some one
recognising its subject.<!-- Page 161 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span></p>

<p>As Foyle switched on the lights in the finger-print department, Green
sat down at a table and with the aid of a magnifying-glass carefully
scrutinised the prints which he carried on a sheet of paper. Ranged on
one side of the room were high filing cabinets divided into
pigeon-holes, numbered from 1 to 1024. In them were contained hundreds
of thousands of finger-prints of those known to be criminals. It was for
the detectives to find if among them were any identical with those of
their prisoner.</p>

<p>The whole science of finger-prints for police purposes resolves itself
into the problem of classification. It would be an impossible task to
compare myriads of records each time. The system employed was absurdly
simple to put into execution. In five minutes Green had the
finger-prints of the two hands classified into "loops" and "whorls" and
had made a rough note.</p>

<p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0.1em;">"W.L.W.L.L.</p>
<p  style="text-align: center; margin-top: 0.1em;">"L.W.W.L.W."</p>

<p>That done, the remainder was purely a question of arithmetic. Each whorl
was given an arbitrary number according to its position. A whorl
occurring in the first pair counts 16 in the second, the third 4, the
fourth 2, and the fifth 1. Thus Green's effort became&mdash;</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="5" summary="fingerprint calculation">
<tr style="text-align: center;"><td><p style="margin-bottom: 0em;">16</p></td><td><p style="margin-bottom: 0em;">&mdash;</p></td><td><p style="margin-bottom: 0em;">4</p></td><td><p style="margin-bottom: 0em;">&mdash;</p></td><td><p style="margin-bottom: 0em;">&mdash;</p></td><td>&nbsp;</td><td><p style="margin-bottom: 0em;">20</p></td></tr>
<tr style="text-align: center;"><td colspan="5">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</td><td><p style="margin-bottom: 0em; margin-top: 0em;">=</p></td><td>&mdash;&mdash;</td></tr>
<tr style="text-align: center;"><td><p style="margin-top: 0em;">&mdash;</p></td><td><p style="margin-top: 0em;">8</p></td><td><p style="margin-top: 0em;">4</p></td><td><p style="margin-top: 0em;">&mdash;</p></td><td><p style="margin-top: 0em;">1</p></td><td><p style="margin-top: 0em;">&nbsp;</p></td><td><p style="margin-top: 0em;">13</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p>The figure one was added to both numerator and denominator, and Green at
once went to the fourteenth pigeon-hole, in a row of the filing cabinet
numbered 21.<!-- Page 162 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span> There, if anywhere, he would find the record that he
sought. For awhile he was busy carefully looking through the collection.</p>

<p>"Here it is," he said at last and read: "Charles J. Condit. American.
No. 9781 Habitual Convicts' Registry."</p>

<p>"Put 'em back," said Foyle. "We'll find his record in the Registry."</p>

<p>The two detectives, uncertain as to where the regular staff kept the
files of the number they wanted, were some little time in searching. It
was Foyle who at last reached it from a top shelf and ran his eye over
it from the photograph pasted in the top left-hand corner to the meagre
details given below.</p>

<p>"This is our man right enough," he said. "American finger-prints and
photograph supplied by the New York people when he took a trip to this
country five years ago. Never convicted here. It says little about him.
We'll have to cable over to learn what they know."</p>

<p>"That gives us a chance for a remand," remarked Green.</p>

<p>"Exactly. And in the meantime he may tell us something. A prisoner gets
plenty of time for reflection when he's on remand."<!-- Page 163 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVIII" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII"></a>CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>


<p>Five minutes after Big Ben had struck ten o'clock Heldon Foyle walked
into his office to find Sir Ralph Fairfield striding up and down and
glancing impatiently at the clock. He made no direct answer to the
detective's salutation, but plunged at once into the object of his
visit.</p>

<p>"Have you seen the <i>Wire</i> this morning?" he asked abruptly.</p>

<p>Foyle seated himself at his desk, imperturbable and unmoved.</p>

<p>"No," he answered, "but I know of the advertisement that brought you
here. As a matter of fact, I sent it to the paper. I should have called
on you if you hadn't come. Grell meant it for you, right enough."</p>

<p>The significance of the detective's admission that he knew of the
advertisement did not immediately strike Fairfield. He unfolded a copy
of the <i>Daily Wire</i>.</p>

<p>"What do you make of the infernal thing?" he demanded. "It's absolute
Greek to me."</p>

<p>With a letter selected from the pile of correspondence on his desk
unopened in his hand, Heldon Foyle swung round and faced his questioner.</p>

<p>"It's simply a sighting shot, Sir Ralph," he remarked quietly. "Grell
credits you with intelligence enough to remember that number later. Have
you any knowledge of ciphers?"</p>

<p>"I have an elementary idea that to unravel them<!-- Page 164 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span> you work from the most
frequently recurring letter; E, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"That's right," said Foyle. "But there are other ciphers where that
system won't work. Mind you, I don't pose as an expert. If I had a
cipher to unravel, I should go to a man who had specialised in them,
exactly as I should go to a doctor on a medical question. Still, the
advertisement to-day isn't a cipher. It means exactly what it says."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Fairfield drily. "I am now as wise as when I started."</p>

<p>"Sorry," murmured Foyle suavely. "You'll be wiser presently. The thing
isn't complete yet. If you'll excuse me a few minutes, I'll just run
through my letters, and then, if you don't mind taking a little walk,
we'll go and see Lady Eileen Meredith."</p>

<p>Some formal reply rose to Fairfield's lips&mdash;he never knew what. The last
time he had seen Eileen was fixed in his memory. Then she had
practically denounced him as a murderer. Since then she had learnt that
every shadow of suspicion had been cleared away from him. How would she
receive him if he visited her unexpectedly with Foyle? Why did Foyle
wish him to go? Perhaps, after all, there was nothing in it. He told
himself fiercely that there was no reason why the meeting should
embarrass him. Some day, sooner or later, they would have to meet. Why
not now? He was hungry for a sight of her, and yet he was as nervous as
a child at the thought of going to her.</p>

<p>The slamming of a drawer and the soft click of a key in the lock told
that Foyle had finished. He picked up a copy of the <i>Daily Wire</i> and his
hat and gloves.<!-- Page 165 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now, Sir Ralph," he said briskly, and together they descended the
narrow flight of stone steps which leads to one of Scotland Yard's back
doors. The detective was apparently in a talkative mood, and Fairfield
got no chance to ask the questions that were filling his mind. Spite of
himself he became interested in the flow of anecdotes which came from
his companion's lips. There were few corners of the world, civilised or
uncivilised, where the superintendent had not been in the course of his
career. He had the gift of dramatic and humorous story-telling. He spoke
of adventures in Buenos Ayres, in South Africa, Russia, the United
States, and a dozen other countries, of knife-thrusts and revolver
shots, of sand-bagging and bludgeoning, without any suspicion of
vaunting himself. The baronet made some comment.</p>

<p>"No," said Foyle. "Take it all round, a detective's life is more
monotonous than exciting. It's taken me thirty years to collect the
experiences I'm telling you about. Things always happen unexpectedly.
Some of my narrowest squeaks have taken place in England, in the West
End. Why, I was nearly shot in one of the best hotels by an officer sent
over from the United States to take charge of a man I had arrested. He
was the sheriff of some small town and had a bit of a reputation as a
gun-man, and had come over with the district attorney to escort the chap
back. They did themselves well while they were here waiting to catch a
boat back. One morning I strolled into the hotel, and who should run
into me but the attorney with a face the colour of white paper.</p>

<p>"'That you, chief?' he gasps. 'For God's sake<!-- Page 166 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span> don't go upstairs. &mdash;&mdash;'s
on the landing, blazing drunk and with his gun out. He's a dead shot.'</p>

<p>"Well, I could see that a Wild West sheriff was out of place in a decent
hotel, so up I went. He had me covered like a flash, and I yelled out to
him not to shoot.</p>

<p>"'Hello, chief,' he says. 'That's all right. Come right up. I won't do a
thing. Just wait till I've plugged that cur of an attorney and we'll go
and have a drink.'</p>

<p>"By this time I was up level with him. I daren't risk trying to get the
revolver from him, for he was a quick shot, so I pushed my arm through
his.</p>

<p>"'I haven't got much time, sheriff,' says I. 'Let's go and have a drink
first, and you settle up with him afterwards.'</p>

<p>"'That's a bet,' he says, and I led him down to the bar. I persuaded him
to try a new drink of my own invention&mdash;its chief component was
soda-water&mdash;and followed it up with strong hot coffee. Meanwhile I
managed to get the gun away, on the pretext of admiring it. He was
reluctant at first, telling me I could have it for keeps after he had
finished that cur of an attorney. But I got it, and he was fairly sober
by the time I left him.</p>

<p>"Then there was a sequel. I had warned the sheriff and the attorney, who
had made up their differences, that the man they had got was a slippery
customer to handle. However, they got him in the boat all right. When
they got to New York I had a cable from the captain&mdash;a friend of mine.
He said the prisoner had not only cleared off the ship by himself, but
had carried away the hand-baggage of his escort."<!-- Page 167 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span></p>

<p>This reminiscence had brought them to Berkeley Square. Fairfield felt
his heart thumping quickly although his face was impassive as the door
was opened in response to Foyle's ring. She might be out; she might
refuse to see them. Neither of the two alternatives happened. Within
three minutes Eileen had descended to them in the drawing-room.</p>

<p>She stopped, a graceful figure in black, by the doorway, and gave a
barely perceptible start as her eyes rested on the baronet. She bowed
coldly.</p>

<p>"I did not know you were here, Sir Ralph. I understood Mr. Foyle wished
to see me."</p>

<p>She was frigid and self-possessed. He had half expected some expression
of apology for the wrong she had done him, but she entirely ignored
that. But that Fairfield had himself well in hand he would have openly
resented the snub inflicted on him. It was Foyle who answered.</p>

<p>"I brought Sir Ralph here. I thought his presence might be necessary."</p>

<p>She moved across the room, and sank on a couch with a petulant frown.</p>

<p>"Well, I suppose you have some disagreeable business to transact. Let us
get it over."</p>

<p>The superintendent knew that he was dealing with a woman entirely on her
guard. Her steady grey eyes were fixed on him closely, as though she
could read his thoughts. He thought he could detect a slight twitching
of the slender hands that rested idly on her lap.</p>

<p>"I want to know," he said slowly, "the meaning of the advertisement
addressed to you by Robert Grell in this morning's <i>Daily Wire</i>."<!-- Page 168 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span></p>

<p>He could have sworn that his shot had hit, that she flinched a little as
he spoke. But if so she showed no further sign. Instead, her face was
all astonishment as she replied&mdash;</p>

<p>"I don't quite understand. What advertisement? I know nothing about Mr.
Grell since he left Grosvenor Gardens. Will you explain?"</p>

<p>Deliberately the superintendent took from his breast-pocket a copy of
the <i>Daily Wire</i>, folded back at the personal column, and read:</p>

<p>"E. &pound;27.14.5. To-morrow. B."</p>

<p>"That," he said, "is addressed to you. It is hardly worth while denying
knowledge of it. It was found last night on a man arrested for attempted
housebreaking at Mr. Grell's house. I ordered that it be sent to the
paper, together with another intended for the eye of Sir Ralph
Fairfield."</p>

<p>Her interest was plainly awakened.</p>

<p>"Then the other was for you!" she cried, turning to Fairfield. "I
wondered if&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She paused with the realisation that she had admitted what she had a
moment before denied. Foyle's foot pressed heavily on the toe of the
baronet to warn him not to speak.</p>

<p>"Yes, it was for Sir Ralph," he said. "That is why I brought him here.
It is you, though, who hold the key to this mystery. We know that you
would have sent your jewels to Grell, that you are in communication with
his friends. You are young, Lady Eileen, and don't realise that you are
playing with fire. Your silence can do your lover no good&mdash;it may do him
and yourself harm. You have been visited by the Princess<!-- Page 169 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span> Petrovska, an
adventuress not fit to touch the hem of your skirt. You are already
involved. Take the advice of a man old enough to be your father, and
confide in us."</p>

<p>She had risen, and her slim form towered over the seated detective. She
seemed about to resent his words, but suddenly burst into a ripple of
laughter.</p>

<p>"You would be offensive if you were not amusing, Mr. Foyle. Don't you
think my help would be a little superfluous, since you know so much?"
she asked with a quietness that robbed the remark of some of its
bitterness. "I think you had better go now."</p>

<p>"I am sorry," said Foyle. "You may regret that you did not take my
advice."</p>

<p>She herself held the door open for them to pass out. To the surprise of
Fairfield, she held out her hand to him while ignoring the detective.</p>

<p>"Come back alone as soon as you can," she whispered. "I want to speak to
you."</p>

<p>Foyle had apparently neither heeded nor heard. Yet, as soon as they were
out of eye-shot of the house, he turned to Fairfield.</p>

<p>"She asked you to go back?"</p>

<p>"Eh?" The baronet was startled. "Yes. How did you know? Did you overhear
her?"</p>

<p>"No, but I hoped she would when I took you there. That was the whole
reason of our visit. I didn't expect to get her to say or admit
anything."</p>

<p>Fairfield came to an abrupt halt and gripped his companion by the arm.</p>

<p>"You intended&mdash; For what reason? How could you know?"<!-- Page 170 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span></p>

<p>"Absolute common sense, my dear sir. That's all. Absolute common sense.
If you are a chess-player, you know that the man who can foretell what
move his opponent is going to make usually wins. Here, let's find a
quiet Piccadilly tea-shop and I'll tell you all about it."</p>

<p>There is no place which one may find more convenient for a quiet
conversation than the London tea-shop before twelve in the morning. Over
a cup of coffee in the deserted smoking-room Foyle spoke to the point.</p>

<p>"I did not tell you why I took you to see Lady Eileen, because I was
afraid you might refuse. She has been antagonistic to you hitherto. The
fact that Grell advertised you in somewhat the same manner as herself
has given her the idea that, after all, you too might be trying to
shield him. Naturally, she wants to be certain, in order that you may
join forces. That's why I prevented you saying anything. Now, if you go
back to her you may tell her that I practically forced you to accompany
me. You can win her confidence, and through her we may get on the right
track."</p>

<p>An angry flush mounted to Fairfield's temples.</p>

<p>"In short," he said curtly, "you want me to act as a spy on an
unsuspecting girl. No, thanks. That's not in our bargain."</p>

<p>He was genuinely angry at the proposal. The superintendent saw that he
had been too blunt, and made haste to repair his error.</p>

<p>"Don't be in a hurry," he protested. "The girl, as I told her, is
beginning to be mixed up in a dangerous business. This is the only way
to extricate her.<!-- Page 171 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span> You may help her and Grell and us by doing as I ask.
Consider it coolly, and you will see it is the best thing to do."</p>

<p>Sir Ralph set down his cup and fingered his watch-chain. Foyle signalled
the waitress, paid the bill, lit a cigar and waited.</p>

<p>"I'll have to think over it," said Fairfield thoughtfully. "Give me an
hour or two."</p>

<p>"Right you are," agreed the detective heartily, and they made their way
out into the street.<!-- Page 172 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIX" id="CHAPTER_XXIX"></a>CHAPTER XXIX</h2>


<p>It was with mixed feelings that Fairfield yielded at last to Foyle's
arguments and returned to see Eileen Meredith. To his consent he had
attached the condition that he was to be allowed to use his own judgment
as to how much of the interview he should communicate to the detective,
and with this Foyle had to be content.</p>

<p>The baronet found the girl waiting for him, her face alight with
eagerness. She was in her own boudoir, luxuriously ensconced in a big
arm-chair, and she smiled brightly at him&mdash;such a smile as he had not
seen since before the murder. He obeyed her invitation to sit down.</p>

<p>"You wanted to see me alone," he said.</p>

<p>She nodded. "Yes, I want to know if we are allies&mdash;or enemies. I know I
have treated you abominably, but I was driven half mad by the thought
that Bob was dead. Now we are working together&mdash;are we not?"</p>

<p>He made a little gesture with his hands, helplessly as one at a loss.</p>

<p>"In so far as we both wish to get Grell out of his difficulty&mdash;and I
wish I knew what that was&mdash;yes," he replied. "I don't believe him to be
a murderer, but why does he remain in hiding? He is not the sort of man
to do foolish things, and that is foolish on the face of it. He has some
strong reason for being out of the way. Can you explain?"<!-- Page 173 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span></p>

<p>She pulled her chair closer to him, and laid one slim hand on his.</p>

<p>"I cannot explain&mdash;I can only trust. He looked to us to help him. I know
that he wants money, for he sent a friend to tell me. I had none, but I
gave her my jewels. Detectives were watching her, and they, with the
connivance of my father, took them from her. Now, you, his most intimate
friend, must help him. He has given you the key to the cipher which will
appear, and then, I suppose, he will tell you how to get it to him."</p>

<p>She had apparently taken it for granted that the baronet was with her in
whole-souled devotion to her lover. His fingers beat a tattoo on his
knee.</p>

<p>"So that advertisement was the key to a cipher? Do you know when I shall
get a message?"</p>

<p>"I shall get one to-morrow. You&mdash;who knows?"</p>

<p>"Then you can tell me how to read it?"</p>

<p>She hesitated a moment, finger on chin. Then, animated by a quick
resolve, she moved to a little inlaid desk and unlocked a drawer. She
returned with a piece of paper in her hand.</p>

<p>"What was the number mentioned in your advertisement?"</p>

<p>"2315."</p>

<p>For a little the only sound in the room was the scratching of pencil on
paper. At last she finished, and handed the result to him. He wrinkled
his brows as he studied it.</p>

"The bottom line is the top one turned into cipher," she explained. "The
middle line is the key number. In the first word you take the second
letter from T, the third from H, the first from I, and so on. It is a
cipher that cannot be unravelled without the key number. H becomes K
once and M once."</p>

<p>"I see." The simplicity of it at once dawned on him. "That was what
Foyle meant when he said that some ciphers could not be solved by the
recurring E," he said unthinkingly.</p>

<p>She had risen and flung away from him in quick revulsion. One glance at
her face told him what he had done.</p>

<p>"You spy!" There was stinging scorn in her tone. "You have talked it
over with Foyle, and that man knows all. You are here to worm out what I
know in order to betray your friend. Oh, don't trouble to lie,"&mdash;as he
would have spoken,&mdash;"I can see your object. And I nearly fell into the
trap."</p>

<p>The man was not without dignity, as he stood a little white but steady.
"You may call me what you like," he said in a low voice. "Spy, if you
will. Believe me or not, I have acted for the best, for you and for
Grell. You once called me a murderer&mdash;with what justification you now
know. Are you so ready to judge hastily again?"</p>

<p>If he had hoped to move her from her gust of passion, he quickly learned
his mistake. Her lips curled in contempt, and, drawing her skirts aside
as she passed him as though a touch might contaminate her, she swept to
the doorway. For one instant she stood posed.<!-- Page 175 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span></p>

<p>"You call yourself a spy. It is a good name. For a police spy there is
no room in this house."</p>

<p>With that she was gone. The man had flushed under the biting contempt in
her voice and words, and now stood for a little with hands tightly
clenched, gazing after her. He felt that, from her point of view at
least, there was some truth in her words. He was&mdash;whatever his
motives&mdash;a police spy. And yet he was but concerned to clear up the
horrible tangle in which his friend and the girl had become involved.</p>

<p>He did not know that he was watched from behind the curtains as he
walked blindly into the street. Eileen, with lips firmly set and face
tense, was concealed behind curtains. No sooner had he gone than she
hurriedly dressed herself and ordered an electric brougham. She had come
to believe that her lover's safety depended on her actions that day.
Foyle knew the secret of the cipher, and Grell's advertisement told her
that he intended communicating something to her by that method the next
day. At all costs she must prevent him betraying himself.</p>

<p>Only one course occurred to her. She must go to the office of the <i>Daily
Wire</i> and prevent his advertisement from appearing. How she was to do it
she had not the slightest idea. That she left for later reflection.</p>

<p>The car rolled smoothly towards Fleet Street, but no inspiration came to
her. She alighted at the advertisement office, with its plate glass and
gilded letters, and was attended by an obsequious clerk. Outwardly calm,
but with her heart beating quickly beneath her furs, she put her inquiry
to a sleek-haired clerk. He<!-- Page 176 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span> was polite but firm. It was quite possible
that such an advertisement as she mentioned had been sent for insertion
the following day, and again it might not. In any case he was forbidden
to give any information. It would be quite out of the question to stop
any advertisement unless she held the receipt.</p>

<p>"But if the advertisement has not already been given in, can you give a
note to whoever brings it?" she asked, in a flash of inspiration.</p>

<p>"Yes, that could be done." She tore off her glove, and with slim,
nervous fingers wrote hurriedly. The sleek clerk supplied her with an
envelope, and as she placed her message in it and handed it to him she
felt it was a forlorn hope. There was only one other way of outwitting
the detectives. Should Grell give any address in his message, she must
reach him early in the morning before the police could act. A couple of
questions elicited the fact that the paper would be on sale by four the
next morning. That would mean another journey to Fleet Street, for the
ordinary news-agents' shops would not be open at that time. The brougham
turned about and began the homeward journey.</p>

<p>A respectably dressed working man, who had apparently been absorbed in a
page of advertisements of situations vacant displayed on a slab in the
window, slouched into the office, and a man bareheaded and wearing a
frock-coat moved briskly forward, apparently to attend to him. Yet it
was more than coincidence that they met at a deserted end of the
counter.</p>

<p>"That was Lady Eileen Meredith," said the workman, in a quick, low
voice. "What did she want?"<!-- Page 177 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span></p>

<p>"She's guessed that we know the cipher," retorted the other. "She gave a
letter to be handed over to whoever brings the advertisement. Here is
what she says." He pulled the letter which Eileen had written five
minutes before from its envelope: "'The police know the cipher. Be very
cautious. R.&nbsp;F. is acting with them.' I'll telephone to Mr. Foyle at
once. You had better stay outside."</p>

<p>The second man went back to the pavement and resumed his study of the
advertisement board, but a close observer might have seen that his eyes
wandered past it now and again to the persons inside the office. Half an
hour went by. Then the frock-coated man inside took a silk hat from a
peg and placed it on his head. Simultaneously a woman went out. A dozen
paces behind her went the workman, and a dozen paces behind him the
frock-coated man.</p>

<p>Heldon Foyle had selected his subordinates well for their work. Acting
on the policy of leaving nothing to chance, he had taken a hint from the
advertisement addressed to Eileen, and had the office watched from the
time it opened. It was simple to get the manager's permission to place
one man within, and to get him to direct the clerks to pass through his
hands all cipher advertisements for the personal column. If the
advertisement came through the post, their time would be thrown away. If
it was delivered by hand, there was a chance of learning whence it had
been dispatched. The intervention of Lady Eileen was an accident that
could not have been foreseen. In that matter luck had played into
Foyle's hands.<!-- Page 178 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXX" id="CHAPTER_XXX"></a>CHAPTER XXX</h2>


<p>Between Berkeley Square and Scotland Yard, Fairfield consumed ten
cigarettes in sharp jerky puffs. Yet he was scarcely conscious of
lighting one. Indeed, as he climbed the wide flight of steps at the main
entrance, it seemed as though no palpable interval of time had elapsed
since he had been practically turned out of her father's house by Eileen
Meredith.</p>

<p>Heldon Foyle put away the bundle of documents that contained the history
of the case as the baronet was announced, and waved his visitor to a
chair.</p>

<p>"Well?" he asked.</p>

<p>Fairfield shrugged his shoulders. "A nice mess you've got me into," he
complained. "Why didn't you tell me you knew the secret of the cipher?"</p>

<p>The detective's face was full of ingenuous surprise as he answered&mdash;</p>

<p>"Didn't I? I thought I made it perfectly clear to you. I am sorry that
you misunderstood. I should have made it plainer. What has gone wrong?"</p>

<p>Sir Ralph made an impatient gesture. "Oh, what's the use of talking
nonsense? You did not tell me that you knew the cipher, and as a
consequence Lady Eileen now knows that you know."</p>

<p>The superintendent gave no indication of the chagrin with which the news
filled him. His features were perfectly expressionless. A part of his
plans had failed from excess of caution. He did not need Fair<!-- Page 179 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>field to
tell him what had happened. He could make a fairly accurate guess as to
the manner in which he had been unwittingly betrayed. His thoughts
turned at once to the question of what the girl would do. If he had
judged her right, she would try to warn Grell. Either she knew his
address or not, but it was unlikely that she did, as they were
communicating in cipher. The obvious thing for her to do was to try to
stop the advertisement. There was, however, little he could do. He had
men on duty in Berkeley Square and in Fleet Street. He would soon hear
of any new developments.</p>

<p>"That's a pity," he said reflectively. "It may mean a re-arrangement of
our plans. And believe me, Sir Ralph, I badly regret now that I did not
go into fuller details with you. What happened?"</p>

<p>Stumblingly, Sir Ralph recapitulated the scene at Berkeley Square,
giving even the epithets by which the girl had addressed him. Foyle
tapped lightly on his desk with the end of a penholder. The event had
been as he thought. He looked Sir Ralph straight in the eye.</p>

<p>"She told you that you were a spy&mdash;that I had used you as a tool," he
said sharply. "You have been hurt by her words. I don't want you to feel
that you are anything but a free agent, or to do anything that you
consider dishonourable. But I must know whether you are still willing to
act with us, or whether you wish to stand aside."</p>

<p>Fairfield threw the stump of cigarette viciously into the fire.</p>

<p>"I am acting with you, of course," he answered<!-- Page 180 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span> sullenly, "though I wish
you to ask for my help only when it is absolutely necessary. What I
complain of is, that I have not been frankly treated, and that I have
been placed in an invidious position with Lady Eileen. You must remember
that I have feelings, and that it is not pleasant to be told one is
acting as a spy, especially by&mdash;by an old friend. You know, Mr. Foyle,
that I have only been wishful to serve those I have known."</p>

<p>There was something pathetic in his endeavour to justify his actions to
himself. Foyle murmured a sympathetic, "I understand&mdash;yes, yes, I know,"
and then became thoughtful.</p>

<p>"After all," he said at last, "this does not make us so very badly off.
You are openly on our side now, Sir Ralph, so there can be no fear of
your again being accused of acting in an underhand manner. There is
nothing more to be done at the moment. I will keep you posted as to any
steps we are taking."</p>

<p>"Very well. Good morning, Mr. Foyle."</p>

<p>The baronet was gone. The superintendent resumed his perusal of
documents. He felt some little compunction at what had happened. Yet it
was his business to clear up the mystery, and to use what instruments
came to his hand, so long as the law was not violated. There is a code
of etiquette in detective work in which the first and most important
rule is: "Take advantage of every chance of bringing a criminal to
justice." In using Fairfield as an instrument, Foyle was merely
following that code.</p>

<p>In a little, Foyle had finished and sent for Green. The chief inspector
came with a report.<!-- Page 181 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span></p>

<p>"A woman brought the advertisement to Fleet Street, sir," he said.
"Blake has just telephoned up that he and Lambert are keeping her under
observation. He 'phoned earlier that Lady Eileen Meredith had been
there."</p>

<p>"Yes, I suppose so. What does the advertisement say?"</p>

<p>"He couldn't tell me on the 'phone. He had to hurry away to look after
the woman. It is being sent up by taxicab."</p>

<p>"That's good. By the way, Green, keep half-a-dozen men handy, and be
about yourself."</p>

<p>"Very good, sir. Is there anything on?"</p>

<p>"I don't quite know. We may have to go out in a hurry. I'll tell you
after we have deciphered the advertisement."<!-- Page 182 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXI" id="CHAPTER_XXXI"></a>CHAPTER XXXI</h2>


<p>It was with an eagerness sternly suppressed that Heldon Foyle took from
a messenger the note which he knew contained Grell's advertisement.
Although outwardly he was the least emotional of men, he always worked
at high tension in the investigation of a case. No astronomer could
discover a new comet, no scientist a new element with greater delight
than that which animated the square-faced detective while he was working
on a case.</p>

<p>He drew out the sheet of paper gingerly between his finger-nails, and
tested it with graphite. Eight or nine finger-prints, some blurred, some
plain, appeared black against the white surface, and he gave an
ejaculation of annoyance.</p>

<p>"The fools! I warned them to handle it carefully. Now they've been and
mixed the whole lot up."</p>

<p>He blew down one of the half-dozen speaking tubes hanging at the side of
his desk, and gave a curt order. When Green appeared he was engrossed in
copying the advertisement on to a writing-pad. He laid down his pen
after a while.</p>

<p>"That you, Green? Send this up to Grant, and ask him to have it
photographed. See if he can pick out any of the prints as being in the
records or bearing on the case. Somebody's been pawing this all over,
and the prints are probably spoilt. It's been printed out, too, so there
isn't much chance of identifying the<!-- Page 183 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span> writing. Anyhow, we'll have a look
more closely at it when the finger-print people have done."</p>

<p>He bent once more to his desk with the copy of the cipher. He knew the
key, and it was not necessary to resort to an expert. By the time the
chief inspector came back he had a neatly copied translation on his pad.</p>

<p>"Listen to this, Green," he said.</p>

<p>"'E.&nbsp;M. Am now safe on board a barge moored below Tower Bridge, where no
one will think of looking for me. Have good friends but little money,
owing to action of police. Trust, little girl, you still believe in my
innocence, although things seem against me. There are reasons why I
should not be questioned. Shall try to embark before the mast in some
outward bound vessel. Crews will not be scrutinised so sharply as
passengers. There are those who will let you know my movements. Fear the
police may tamper with your correspondence, but later on when hue and
cry has died down will let you know all.'"</p>

<p>The two detectives looked at each other.</p>

<p>"A barge below Tower Bridge," repeated Green, with something like
admiration. "That was a good shot. He might have stayed there till
doomsday without our hitting on him, or any one taking any notice of
him."</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Foyle. "A newcomer on the river would attract
attention. These water-men know each other. There's only one way that I
can see in which he would avoid being talked about. He is a watchman."</p>

<p>"You're right, sir," agreed the other emphatically. "This is a matter
where Wrington of the Thames<!-- Page 184 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span> Division will be able to help us. Hope we
can find him at Wapping. Shall I ring through?"</p>

<p>"There's no hurry for a minute or two," said Foyle. "Let's get the hang
of the thing right. There's probably some hundreds of barges below Tower
Bridge. It will be as well to keep a close eye on the docks and shipping
offices. You see, he asserts his innocence."</p>

<p>"H'm," commented Green, with an intonation that meant much. "He says,
too, that there are reasons why he shouldn't be questioned."</p>

<p>"Well, we shall see. There had better be an all-station message about
the docks. Send two or three men down to Tilbury to watch outgoing boats
there. We shan't need any other men from here. Wrington's staff know the
river, and will get on best with them. I don't want to leave here until
Blake lets us know more about the woman who left the advertisement. That
gives us another possible clue."</p>

<p>It was some time before Wrington, the divisional detective-inspector at
the head of the detective staff of the Thames Division, could be found,
for like other branches of the C.I.D. he and his men did their work
systematically, and usually left their office at nine o'clock only to
return at six. At length, however, he was found at a wharfinger's
office, where there had arisen some question of a missing case of
condensed milk. Within half an hour he was at Scotland Yard.</p>

<p>A tall man with tired grey eyes, about the corners of which were tiny
wrinkles, with a weather-beaten face and grey moustache, he aimed to
look something like a riverside tradesman. There was a meekness in<!-- Page 185 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span> his
manner and speech that deceived people who did not know his reputation.
He spoke five languages fluently, and two more indifferently. Along the
banks of the thirty-five-mile stretch of river for which he was
responsible he had waged incessant warfare on thieves and receivers for
thirty years, till now practically all serious crime had disappeared.</p>

<p>He it was who, a dozen years before, had fought hand to hand with a
naked and greased river thief armed with a knife, in a swaying boat
under Blackfriars Bridge; he, too, solved the mystery of a man found
dead in the Thames who had been identified by a woman as her husband&mdash;a
dare-devil adventurer and unscrupulous blackmailer, who was declared by
a doctor and a coroner's jury to have been murdered. Step by step he had
traced it all out, from the moment when a seaman on a vessel moored at
one of the wharves had taken a fancy to bathe, and being unable to swim
had fastened a line round his waist and jumped overboard. He had
neglected to make the end on board properly fast and was swept away by
the current. The rope had twirled round him, and as the body swelled
became fixed. A blow on the head from the propeller of a tug completed a
maze of circumstantial evidence which might have served as an excuse to
most men for giving up the problem. Yet Wrington had solved it, and the
record, which had never seen the light of publicity, was hidden in the
archives of the service.</p>

<p>This was the man Foyle had now called in. He stood, with stooping
shoulders, nervously twisting his shabby hat, apparently ill at ease.
His nervousness<!-- Page 186 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span> dropped from him like a garment, however, when he
spoke. Foyle made clear to him the purport of the excursion they were to
embark on.</p>

<p>"Very good, sir," he said. "If you think the man you want is on the
river, we will find him. I guess, as you say, he's got a job as a
watchman. He's probably had to get somebody to buy a barge, for they
don't give these jobs without some kind of reference."</p>

<p>"A reference could easily have been forged. But that doesn't matter. How
soon can you get your men together?"</p>

<p>"An hour,&mdash;perhaps two. They're scattered all over the place. I sent out
to fetch 'em before I left Wapping."</p>

<p>"Three or four will be enough. With Green and yourself and myself we
should be able to tackle anything. Have a launch and a motor-boat at
Westminster Bridge Pier in a couple of hours' time. If you can borrow
them off some one, so that they don't look like police craft, so much
the better."</p>

<p>"I can do it, sir."</p>

<p>"Good. In two hours' time, then."</p>

<p>And Heldon Foyle turned away, dismissing the subject from his mind.
Green had gone upstairs to find how Grant of the Finger-print Department
had progressed in his scrutiny of the finger-prints on the
advertisement. He found his specialist colleague with a big enlargement
of the paper on which the advertisement had been written mounted on
paste-board, and propped up in front of him, side by side with an
enlargement of the prints found on the dagger.</p>

<p>"Any luck?" asked Green.<!-- Page 187 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span></p>

<p>Grant shifted his magnifying glass to another angle and grunted.</p>

<p>"Can't tell yet," he said irritably. "I've only just started. Go away."</p>

<p>"Sorry I spoke, old chap," said the other. "Don't shoot; I'm going."</p>

<p>Grant rested his chin on one elbow and stared sourly at the intruder.</p>

<p>"Great heavens!" he said. "Isn't it enough to have two of my men ill
when there are four hundred prints to classify, to have three newspaper
reporters and a party of American sociological researchers down on me in
one day, without&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But Green had fled to the more tranquil quarters on the first floor.</p>

<p>"Mr. Foyle asking for you, sir," said the clerk.</p>

<p>He pulled open the door of the superintendent's room. Foyle had got his
hat and coat on.</p>

<p>"Blake's wired that the woman has taken a ticket for Liverpool," he
said. "He's gone on the same train. Now that's settled, let's see if we
can't hurry Wrington up."<!-- Page 188 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXII" id="CHAPTER_XXXII"></a>CHAPTER XXXII</h2>


<p>In the corner of the first-class carriage farthest away from the
platform, the Princess Petrovska sat with her hands on her lap and a rug
round her knees, glancing idly from under her long eyelashes at the
people thronging the Euston departure platform. Her eyes rested
incuriously now and again upon a couple of men who stood in conversation
by a pile of luggage some distance away, but within eyeshot of the
compartment.</p>

<p>She had some vague recollection of having seen one of the men before,
and though she remained apparently languidly interested in the business
of the platform, she was racking her brains to think who he was or where
she had seen him. It was recently, she was certain. Suddenly she leaned
forward, and her smooth brow contracted in a frown. Yes&mdash;she was nearly
certain. He had an overcoat and a silk hat on now, but when she last saw
him he had been a bare-headed, frock-coated clerk in the advertisement
office of the <i>Daily Wire</i>. The frown disappeared and she dropped back.
But behind the placid face an alert brain was working. Had the man
followed her, or was it a mere coincidence? Was he a detective? With an
effort of will she stilled the apprehension in her breast. Her
confidence reasserted itself. Even if he were a detective, what had she
to fear? She had merely delivered a cipher advertisement over the
counter. It<!-- Page 189 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span> was unlikely that it would be read by others than the
person for whom it was intended. Even if it were, there was nothing in
it to incriminate her.</p>

<p>Her lips parted in a contemptuous smile.</p>

<p>"I don't believe he is a detective at all," she murmured.</p>

<p>All doubts on the subject, however, were set at rest as the express
began to glide out of the station. As though taken unawares by its
departure, the man hastily shook hands with his friend and sprinted for
the train, swinging himself into the woman's compartment with a gasp of
relief.</p>

<p>"Phew," he said. "A narrow shave that," and then, as if realising the
sex of his companion, "I&mdash;I beg your pardon. I hope the carriage is not
reserved. If so, I will change."</p>

<p>She smiled winningly at him.</p>

<p>"No, don't disturb yourself, I beg. It would be a pity after all the
trouble you have taken&mdash;to catch the train."</p>

<p>Detective-Inspector Blake was not by any means dull. His immobile
features gave no sign that he was half inclined to believe the woman was
gibing him. "Now, what the devil does she mean by that?" he said, under
his breath. He bowed in acknowledgment of her courtesy, and drawing a
paper from his pocket unfolded it.</p>

<p>"And how is the charming Mr. Foyle?" said the Princess, speaking with a
soft drawl. "I do hope he is still well."</p>

<p>This time Blake was taken unawares. He dropped the paper as though it
were red-hot, and the woman<!-- Page 190 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span> laughed. A moment later he was ashamed of
himself. She had trapped him into a tacit admission that he was a
detective. A surprised denial of acquaintance with Mr. Foyle might have
ended in an apology on her part for a mistake. Well, it was too late
now.</p>

<p>"So you are a colleague of Mr. Foyle's?" she went on, and though her
voice was soft there was a trace of mockery in it. "He is charmingly
considerate to send you to look after me. I was desolated to think that
I should have to take such a long journey by myself."</p>

<p>"The pleasure is mine," said Blake, falling in quickly with the
atmosphere she had set. Nevertheless, he was not quite easy. He recalled
the troubles that had beset Waverley, and half regretted that he had not
brought his companion on the train with him.</p>

<p>"Smoke, if you like," she said, with a gracious wave of her hand. "I
know you are dying to do so. Then we can talk. Do you know, I have long
wished to have a talk with a real detective. Your work must be so
fascinating."</p>

<p>He took a cigarette case slowly from his pocket, and dangled it in his
hand. He had never before seen the Princess, but he was certain of her
identity.</p>

<p>"Indeed," he said grimly. "I thought you had met Mr. Foyle. In fact, I
believe that he afforded you some opportunity of seeing a portion of the
workings of our police system. Do you smoke? May I offer you a
cigarette?"</p>

<p>She selected one daintily.</p>

<p>"Thank you. But that was different. I don't think it quite nice of you
to refer to it. It was all a mistake.<!-- Page 191 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span> Mr. Foyle will tell you so, if
you ask him. Do detectives often make mistakes?"</p>

<p>Her air of refreshing innocence tickled Blake. He laughed.</p>

<p>"Sometimes," he admitted. "I made a mistake just now in coming on this
train alone."</p>

<p>She laughed musically in pure amusement.</p>

<p>"I believe the man is afraid of me," she said, addressing the ceiling.
Then more directly, "Why, what harm could a poor creature like myself do
to a great stalwart man like you? I should have thought you'd greater
sense."</p>

<p>"Common sense is my strong point," he parried.</p>

<p>"And therefore you are afraid," she laughed. "Come&mdash;Mr.&mdash;Mr.&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Smith&mdash;John Smith."</p>

<p>"Mr. John Smith, then. It's a good English name. I shan't do you any
harm. But if you like to lose sight of me when we reach Liverpool&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"It would be worth &pound;50 to you."</p>

<p>He shook his head. "I am afraid, Princess, you have a very poor opinion
of the London police. Besides, I told you just now that common sense was
my strong point."</p>

<p>She shrugged her shoulders for answer. The train droned on. They had
lunch together and chatted on like old friends. It was when they had
returned to their own compartment, and the train was nearing Liverpool,
that Blake found his cigarettes had run short. The Princess produced a
daintily-jewelled enamelled case.<!-- Page 192 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span></p>

<p>"Won't you try one of mine?" she asked. "That is, if you care for
Egyptian."</p>

<p>He took one. What harm would there be in a cigarette? Yet, in half an
hour's time, when the train slowed into Lime Street Station, the
Princess descended to the platform alone. In his corner of the
compartment Blake slumbered stertorously.<!-- Page 193 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXXIII"></a>CHAPTER XXXIII</h2>


<p>Heldon Foyle and Chief Inspector Green paced to and fro along
Westminster Pier watching a couple of motor-boats as they swung across
the eddies to meet them. A bitter wind had chopped the incoming tide
into a quite respectable imitation of a rough sea. There were three men
in each boat. Wrington at the tiller in one, Jones, his lieutenant,
steering the other.</p>

<p>"It's going to be a cold job," commented Foyle, as he turned up his coat
collar and stamped heavily on the frosty boards.</p>

<p>"Ay," agreed Green. Then, without moving his head: "There's that chap
Jerrold of the <i>Wire</i> behind us. Has he got any idea of what we're on?"</p>

<p>Foyle wheeled sharply, and confronted a thin-faced, sallow-complexioned
man with a wisp of black hair creeping from under his hat, and with
sharp, penetrating, humorous eyes. Jerrold was one of the most
resourceful of the "crime investigators" of Fleet Street, and, while he
had often helped the police, he could be a dangerous ally at times. He
started with well-affected surprise as Foyle greeted him.</p>

<p>"Well, I never! How are you, Mr. Foyle? And you, Mr. Green? What are you
doing down here?"</p>

<p>"For the matter of that, what are you doing?" asked the superintendent,
who had made a shrewd guess that he and his companion had been seen from
the Embankment, and that Jerrold, scenting something afoot, had<!-- Page 194 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
descended to wait an opportunity. But Jerrold was ready.</p>

<p>"Me?" he retorted. "Oh, I'm writing a story about Westminster Bridge.
Cracks have developed in the pier. Is it safe? You know the kind of
thing."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know," agreed Foyle, with a smile and a glance at the waiting
boats. "Well, it's nice weather. Green and I are just going off with
Wrington. There's some question of increasing the river staff, and we've
got to go into it."</p>

<p>Jerrold nodded as gravely as though he quite accepted the explanation.
In fact, Foyle, shrewd as he was, could not feel certain that he had.
The journalist took a casual glance about the wide stretch of water, and
with an unconscious gesture that had become habitual with him flung back
the lock of hair that dangled over his right eyebrow.</p>

<p>"Got a minute to spare?" he asked. "A rather quaint thing happened at
our office. You know they're excavating the foundations for a big hotel
in Piccadilly? Well, on Monday a couple of burly navvies, carrying a big
paper parcel, came up to the <i>Wire</i> office and Brashton saw them.</p>

<p>"'Me an' my mate 'ere,' says the spokesman, ''ave been employed on those
works in Piccadilly, and we made an interesting discovery to-day. Seeing
as the <i>Wire</i> is an enterprising paper an' pays for news, we thought as
'ow we'd come along.'</p>

<p>"'Always glad to pay for information if we use it,' says Brashton.</p>

<p>"'We'll leave it to you,' says the spokesman, undoing the parcel. 'Look
at this.'<!-- Page 195 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span></p>

<p>"Inside the wrappings was a battered but full-sized human skeleton.
Brashton was a bit staggered, but put a few more questions to the men,
and they went away. He forgot all about the skeleton till M'Gregor, the
news editor, happened in. Mac's hair stood on end, and he pointed at the
skeleton with a long forefinger.</p>

<p>"'What's that?' he demanded.</p>

<p>"Brashton looked up from some copy he was writing. 'That,' he said
calmly. 'Oh, that's not necessarily for publication; it's just a
guarantee of good faith.' And he explained.</p>

<p>"Mac was horror-struck. He stared at Brashton as though he had taken
leave of his senses.</p>

<p>"'Good God, man,' he cried, 'why did you let them leave it here? It
might have died of the plague or something.' And, stepping back into the
corridor, he yelled for a boy. 'Take that thing away,' he ordered. 'Get
rid of it. Put it in the furnace.'</p>

<p>"Well, they took it down and cremated it. To-day, a fine, old, crusty
police sergeant rolled up to the office. He wanted to see some one, he
said, about the find of a body in Piccadilly.</p>

<p>"Brashton received him suavely. 'Very good of you to come, sergeant,' he
said. 'We're always grateful for any information about matters of
interest.'</p>

<p>"The sergeant fidgeted with his helmet. 'That's all right, sir,' he
said. 'As a matter of fact, though, I've come to you for information
this time. You see, I'm a coroner's officer, and we've got to hold an
inquest, but we ain't got no body to hold it on!'</p>

<p>"For a moment Brashton was flabbergasted, but<!-- Page 196 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span> he recovered himself
almost immediately. 'I'm very sorry,' he apologised, 'but the fact is,
although we had the skeleton here it has&mdash;er&mdash;been mislaid.'</p>

<p>"That coroner's officer," went on Jerrold gravely, "is now looking over
the excavations to see if it's possible to find a few odds and ends to
hold the inquest on. But I see Mr. Green's getting impatient. Don't let
me keep you."</p>

<p>The boats had been brought up to the quay and, as the detectives stepped
aboard, slipped downstream, hugging the Embankment. Foyle turned a
speculative eye on the pier they had just quitted. A steam launch had
just brought up, but Jerrold had vanished. The superintendent swore
softly.</p>

<p>"So that's why he kept us talking," he said. "He suspects something, and
wanted to keep us till he could send for a boat himself. We shall be a
regular procession if we don't stop that." He leaned over and spoke to
Green in the second boat. Immediately it slackened speed, and as the
launch came alongside the chief inspector swung deftly aboard.</p>

<p>"Where's Mr. Jerrold?" he demanded of the man at the wheel.</p>

<p>"Who's he?" was the gruff response.</p>

<p>"Come, you know who he is well enough. He's the man who's borrowed or
hired this craft, and he got on board just now. I want to speak to him.
If he has ordered you to follow us, let me tell you that I am a police
officer, and shall be justified in arresting you for obstructing me in
the execution of my duty if you are not careful."</p>

<p>"Hello, Mr. Green. Threatening the skipper?<!-- Page 197 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span> What's wrong?" said the
equable voice of Jerrold, emerging with cigarette between his teeth
through the sliding door of the saloon.</p>

<p>The detective swung round upon him angrily. "This isn't the game, Mr.
Jerrold. We can't have you following us like this."</p>

<p>The journalist gave a shrug. "Really? Do you object to me having a blow
on the river? Because I'm going on, in any case. I can't help it if
you're going the same way."</p>

<p>Green was helpless, and he knew it. Although he raged inwardly, he knew
that it would be unwise to arrest the journalist, though such a course
might be justified. Apart from the bad feeling such procedure might
create, there was the difficulty of establishing a case without
disclosing the object of their journey. It was a dilemma where diplomacy
might with advantage be employed. He smiled at the reporter.</p>

<p>"Mr. Jerrold, can't we settle this without quarrelling? We're on a queer
job, and you might spoil it all by hanging around. Leave us to it, and
if there's anything fit for publication you shall have first pull. Don't
ask me anything else and I'll promise you that."</p>

<p>"Honour?" queried Jerrold.</p>

<p>"Honour," repeated Green.</p>

<p>"Right you are. Slip off and we'll go back. Ring me up at the office."</p>

<p>The steam launch wheeled about as Green took his place in his own boat.
Both men were satisfied. Each knew that the other would not go back on
his word. The chief inspector's boat caught up with that which<!-- Page 198 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span> carried
Foyle and Wrington just below Waterloo Bridge. They were threading the
tiers of barges moored on the southern side. The group of detectives,
with eyes ceaselessly watchful, passed comments in a low voice. They
were not hopeful of finding their quarry yet. The search was merely one
of precaution. Now and again one of the boats stopped and a man
clambered aboard a barge, dropping back in a few minutes with a shake of
the head. Foyle and Green left all this to the river men. They knew the
work.</p>

<p>But, swift as they were, they made slow progress. Foyle glanced uneasily
at his watch. It was already growing dusk, and the lights on the bridges
were reflected in fantastic shapes from the dark waters. The
superintendent spoke in a low voice to Wrington, who jerked his head in
sharp assent.</p>

<p>"You're right, sir. If we take the likely one now we can leave the
others till we've finished. We'll get on. Let her out, boys."</p>

<p>The two boats leapt forward, unobtrusively stealing a course in the
shadow of the barges. It was delicate work in the gathering darkness,
for many times a lighter swinging at its moorings threatened to crush
them; but always they avoided the danger, though to the untrained
faculties of Foyle it seemed that the margin of safety was no more than
the breadth of a knife blade.</p>

<p>At London Bridge they crossed to the northern side, and here the real
hunt began. Wrington signalled for the lights to be put out, and they
stole forward, two black blotches on the dark water. Once they narrowly
escaped running down a Customs' patrol boat,<!-- Page 199 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span> and voices cursed them
with vigour out of the gloom. Again, as they were about to pass under a
mooring rope, some one yelled to Foyle to duck. The warning came too
late, and he would have been swept into the water but that a ready knife
severed the rope. Then there was a halt for a little, while the barge
was secured again.</p>

<p>"There's a new caretaker on a tier of barges just above Tower Bridge,"
whispered Wrington tensely. "We'll try there first. Keep your voice low
if you want to speak, sir. Sound travels a long way on the water. Ah,
there it is."</p>

<p>Foyle had got good eyesight, but he could make out nothing but a smudge
where Wrington pointed&mdash;a smudge emphasised by a tiny point of twinkling
light. The two motor-boats slowed down and approached, as it were, on
tiptoe one on either side of the vessel. As they came nearer a barge
took shape at the head of a long string.</p>

<p>"Stop her," ordered Wrington. "Now, sir, will you board her with me? Get
ready."</p>

<p>As they lurched against the sides of the craft the two leapt aboard.
Green and Jones had come up from the other side. The superintendent gave
a whispered order, and the other three ranged themselves around a small
deck cabin, while he thrust open the door and entered. It was quite dark
within, and a smell of stale tobacco smoke met his nostrils.</p>

<p>He stood still and lit a match, holding himself in readiness for
anything. A figure was dozing in a chair at the other side of the cabin.
Foyle crossed stealthily and quietly encircled the man around the waist,
press<!-- Page 200 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>ing his arms to his side with all his strength. The man, suddenly
awakened, struggled vigorously.</p>

<p>"Keep still," ordered Foyle, doggedly maintaining his hold. "Hi, Green,
Wrington! Give me a hand here, will you?"<!-- Page 201 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXXIV"></a>CHAPTER XXXIV</h2>


<p>Powerful as he was and with his prisoner at a disadvantage, Foyle found
it all he could do to maintain his hold until his companions broke
through to his help. Even then it was no easy task, and the fight raged
over the tiny cabin with the police hanging on to their prisoner like
dogs to a wounded bear. No one spoke a word; there was only the quick
panting of struggling men, the shuffling of their footsteps, and now and
again a sharp crash as some piece of furniture overturned. Their very
numbers handicapped the police in that confined space. Hands sometimes
tore at Foyle, sometimes at the prisoner. The superintendent hung on
with the tenacity of a bulldog, until a sudden lurch against the side
brought his head sharply in contact with the boarding. Half dazed, he
involuntarily relaxed his grip. The prisoner tore himself away and
struck out viciously. A man fell heavily. For the fraction of a second a
shadowy figure was indistinctly outlined in the doorway. Almost
simultaneously Foyle, Green, and Wrington flung themselves in pursuit.
They were too late. A soft splash told that the man had taken the only
possible avenue of escape.</p>

<p>"Look lively with those boats. He's gone overboard," yelled Wrington.
"Light up and get close in to the bank."</p>

<p>With the alacrity of men well used to sudden emergencies those
detectives in the boats were at work on<!-- Page 202 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span> the word. One darted to cut off
retreat to the northern bank, though the forbidding parapet of the Tower
made it impossible for any man to land for a hundred yards or more. The
other cruised cautiously among the strings of barges, watching for any
attempt to land on one of them.</p>

<p>The superintendent had dashed to the stern of the barge and dropped into
a small dinghy tethered there. At his word the others came running, and
with Wrington at the oars they also crept about in determined search.</p>

<p>"It's hopeless," growled Green, in an undertone. "On a night like this
we might as well look for a needle in a haystack."</p>

<p>"We won't give up yet, anyway," retorted Foyle, and there was an
unwonted irritability in his tone. "We've mucked it badly enough, but
I'm not going to fling it up while there's a sporting chance of finding
him. Do you think he'll be able to swim across the river, Wrington?"</p>

<p>"It would need a good man to do it in his clothes. The tide's running
pretty strong. More likely he's let himself drop down below the bridge,
and will try to pull himself aboard one of these craft."</p>

<p>Heldon Foyle rubbed his chin. Every moment their chances of catching the
fugitive lessened. In the darkness, which the lights from the bridge and
from adjacent boats only made more involved, there was little hope of
finding the man they wanted. He had not been seen from the moment of the
first plunge, and there were a score of places on which he might have
taken refuge, and where, now that he was warned, he could dodge<!-- Page 203 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span> the
searchers. He might have committed suicide, it was true, but somehow
Foyle did not think that likely.</p>

<p>For two hours the search continued, and then Foyle, chilled to the bone,
decided that it was hopeless. Wrington hailed the other boats, and the
detectives returned to the barge. A light thrown into the tiny cabin
disclosed amid the disorder an open kit-bag full of linen. Green pulled
out the top shirt and felt its texture between thumb and finger. Then he
pointed to the name of a West-end maker on the collar.</p>

<p>"Yes, it's hardly the kind of thing a barge watchman would wear,"
commented Foyle. "We'd better take the bag along, and you can go through
it at your leisure. The laundry marks will tell whose they are. You had
better stop here, Wrington, and take charge. Find out whom the barge
belongs to, and make what inquiries you can. Better have it thoroughly
searched, and report to me in the morning. Use your discretion in
detaining any one who comes aboard."</p>

<p>One of the motor-boats took Foyle and Green back to Scotland Yard. Both
were glum and silent: Foyle because his plan had miscarried at the very
moment that he had reached the keystone of the problem; Green because it
was his natural habit. It was easy enough to realise now that the whole
question was one of light. Had some one thought to strike a match while
the struggle was going on there would have been no confusion, and the
man would have been unable to get away.</p>

<p>Nor did the news that awaited Foyle at his office tend to make him more
pleased with the progress of the investigation. A telephone message had
come<!-- Page 204 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span> through the chief of the Liverpool detective force&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"Man found drugged in first-class compartment of express from
London, bears warrant card and other documents identifying him as
Inspector Robert Blake, C.I.D., London. Is now under care of our
surgeon, and has not yet recovered consciousness. In no danger. He
travelled from London with a woman fashionably dressed, dark hair,
dark blue eyes. Am now endeavouring to find her. Can you suggest
any steps we can take?"</p></blockquote>

<p>Foyle banged his fist viciously on his desk. "There! We're not the only
people who have made blunders to-day, Green. Look at that. Wire to them
a full description of this woman Petrovska, and tell 'em to detain her
if they come across her. We charge her with administering a noxious
drug, and that'll hold her safe till we get the business cleared up. If
she's trying to slip out of the country, they're pretty safe to get her
in one of the liners. Wire over our men at Liverpool to the same
effect."</p>

<p>Green slipped away. In a little he returned with a slip of paper in his
hand. "Wire's gone to Liverpool. I've drafted this out for Mr. Jerrold,
if you'll just look at it. I promised him he should know anything there
was to tell."</p>

<p>The sheet of paper read&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"In connection with the investigation into the murder of Mr. Robert
Grell, Superintendent Heldon Foyle, accompanied by Chief
Detective-<!-- Page 205 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>Inspector Green, Divisional Detective-Inspector
Wrington, and other detectives, examined the body of a man found in
the river, whom it was supposed might be the man Goldenburg, for
whom search is being made. The police are of the opinion that the
drowned man is not Goldenburg."</p></blockquote>

<p>A light of amusement twinkled in Foyle's blue eyes.</p>

<p>"Don't you think he'll discover that to be a deliberate lie, Mr. Green?"</p>

<p>"Well," said Green doggedly, "we can't tell him what has happened, and
we've got to satisfy him somehow. I promised to let him know something,
and it's true that a body has been found. I asked Wrington. And it's
true that it's not Goldenburg."</p>

<p>"Oh, all right, let it go. You'd better arrange the laundry inquiry
first thing in the morning. Now let me alone. I want to think."<!-- Page 206 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXV" id="CHAPTER_XXXV"></a>CHAPTER XXXV</h2>


<p>Sir Hilary Thornton had come to Heldon Foyle's stocktaking. The
superintendent, with a mass of papers on the desk in front of him,
talked swiftly, now and again referring to the typewritten index of
reports and statements in order to verify some point. The Assistant
Commissioner occasionally interpolated some question, but for the most
part he remained gravely silent. Foyle recapitulated the events of the
preceding day.</p>

<p>"It was sheer foolishness, Sir Hilary," he admitted bitterly. "If we
hadn't blundered Grell would have been in our hands now. As it is, we
have to begin the search for him all over again."</p>

<p>Through the open window came the rumble of a motor-omnibus used by the
police to test applicants for licenses. Thornton swung the window close.</p>

<p>"You still think that Grell had a hand in it?"</p>

<p>"I'm never positive, Sir Hilary, when it is a question of circumstantial
evidence. But there can be no question that if he is not guilty himself
he knows who is. I am so certain that I had a schedule of witnesses made
out for the Treasury. Here they are."</p>

<p>He selected a sheet of paper and passed it to the other. Thornton read
it and handed it back without comment.</p>

<p>"There are gaps in it, of course," went on Foyle. "As a matter of
evidence, though, practically all we want is to identify the
finger-prints. They of them<!-- Page 207 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>selves would determine the investigation.
But we can't tell whether they are Grell's or not until we get hold of
him. We've identified the linen found in the bag on the barge as having
been bought for Grell, but there is no name or initials on the bag
itself. I have not yet heard from Wrington. He may have something
further to report. About Goldenburg. I got Pinkerton's to look into his
career in America. They have discovered that five years ago he was in
San Francisco for three months, and at that time he was apparently well
supplied with money. Grell arrived there a month before he left, and
they left the city within a day of each other."</p>

<p>"A coincidence."</p>

<p>"It may be or may not. Grell's movements were pretty well chronicled in
the American Press at that time, and it is at any rate conceivable that
Goldenburg went there with the express intention of meeting him. More
than that, Grell was staying at the Waldorf Astoria in New York two
years ago. Goldenburg went straight there from India&mdash;which he had made
too hot to hold him&mdash;stayed at the same hotel, and left within three
days for Cape Town. Why should he go to Cape Town <i>via</i> New York? I may
be right or wrong in the opinion I have formed, but at any rate we have
established a point of contact between the two men."</p>

<p>"There is something in that," agreed Sir Hilary, with a jerky nod of the
head.</p>

<p>"More than that, on the New York visit Goldenburg was accompanied by a
woman whose description in every particular corresponds with that of the
Princess Petrovska&mdash;though she called herself the Hon.<!-- Page 208 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span> Katherine
Balton. There is material enough in that information, Sir Hilary, to
draw a number of conclusions from. At any rate, they go to confirm my
opinions at present. I know very well that there is sometimes smoke
without fire, but my experience is that you can usually safely lay odds
that there is a fire somewhere when you do see smoke."</p>

<p>The elliptic form of speech was sometimes adopted by Heldon Foyle in
discussing affairs with one whose alertness of brain he could depend
upon. Thornton twisted his grey moustache and his eye twinkled
appreciatively.</p>

<p>"That's all right," he said. "But how do you account for Grell finding
people ready to his hand in London to help him disappear at the very
moment he needs them? There are several people mixed up in it, we know;
but how is it that they are all loyal to him? We know that criminals
will not keep faith with each other unless there is some strong
inducement. How do you account for it?"</p>

<p>"There may be a dozen reasons. Purely as an hypothesis, Grell may have a
hold on these people by threatening them with exposure for some crime
they have committed. Self-interest is the finest incentive I know to
silence."</p>

<p>"All the same, it's queer," said Sir Hilary, with a little frown. "What
do you propose to do?"</p>

<p>Heldon Foyle's lips became dogged. "Break 'em up piecemeal as we lay our
hands on 'em now. We've got one&mdash;the man we roped in with Red Ike. He's
as tight as an oyster; but while we've got him he can't do anything to
help his pals. Then there's the<!-- Page 209 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span> Princess. She's as slippery as an eel;
but if the Liverpool people can get hold of her we may reckon she'll be
kept safe for a few weeks on the charge of drugging Blake. Then there's
Ivan Abramovitch. We may be able to lay our fingers on him. If there's
any more in this business I don't know 'em; but every one of the gang we
take means so much less help for Grell."</p>

<p>A discreet knock at the door heralded the entrance of a messenger, who
laid an envelope on the table and silently disappeared.</p>

<p>"Western Union," muttered the superintendent. "This may be something
else from Pinkerton's, Sir Hilary. Don't go yet." And, tearing open the
envelope, he crossed the room and pulled down a code-book. In a little
he had deciphered the cable. "We're getting closer," he said.
"Pinkerton's have got hold of 'Billy the Scribe,' who identified the
photograph of the dagger with which the murder was committed as one that
he believes was in the possession of Henry Goldenburg when he last saw
him. That may be fancy or invention, or it may be important. Hello! what
is it?"</p>

<p>It was Green who had interrupted the conference. "Lady Eileen Meredith,
sir&mdash;Machin reports that she left her home at five this morning, walked
to Charing Cross Station, bought a copy of the <i>Daily Wire</i>, looked
hurriedly through it, and then worked out something on a small notebook.
Then she returned home, and came out again in half an hour's time and
went to Waterloo Bridge floating station. There she asked to see one of
the detective branch, and they referred her to headquarters at Wapping
after nine this morning.<!-- Page 210 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span> Machin says he had no chance to telephone
through before. She has not gone to Wapping," he added, as he saw the
eyes of his chief seek the clock. "She went straight back home and has
not come out since."</p>

<p>A low whistle came from between Foyle's teeth and his eyes met Thornton.
"She knew the advertisement was to appear in the <i>Daily Wire</i>, and she
got up early to warn Grell that we know, in case he should give an
address. She did not discover a little paragraph of Mr. Green's
invention till after she returned home, and then her curiosity was
stirred, and she hoped, by going to Waterloo, to find a subordinate
detective whom she might pump. What do you think, Green?"</p>

<p>"I agree with you, sir. She'll turn up here later, I shouldn't wonder."</p>

<p>Sir Hilary Thornton strode to the door, returning the greeting of
Wrington, whom he passed as he retired. The river man was evidently
pleased with himself. Foyle took a place in front of the fire and
waited.</p>

<p>"Had a cold night?" he queried.</p>

<p>"Been too busy to think about it, sir," he chuckled. "We discovered that
the owners of the barge engaged the man who gave the name of Floyd on
the written recommendation of a firm of steamship agents&mdash;that, by the
way, was forged, for the agents deny all knowledge of the man. He was
supposed to have been an American sailor. Once or twice he has been
visited on the boat by a couple of men who pulled up in a dinghy hired
from Blackfriars. The regular waterman hardly ever caught a glimpse of
him&mdash;he never showed himself by day. This morning a letter was sent<!-- Page 211 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
aboard addressed to James Floyd, Esq. I never opened it, thinking
perhaps you might prefer to do so. We searched the barge from end to
end, and Jones is outside with a bag of different things you might like
to see. What I thought most important, however, was this."</p>

<p>He dipped his hand in his jacket pocket and, withdrawing a small package
wrapped in newspaper, carefully unfolded it. Something fell with a
tinkle on Foyle's desk.</p>

<p>"By the living jingo!" ejaculated Green. "It's the sheath of the
dagger!"</p>

<p>The superintendent picked up the thing&mdash;a small sheath of bright steel
with, on the outside, a screw manipulating a catch by which it might be
fastened to a belt. He handled it delicately from the ends.</p>

<p>"I believe you're right," he said. "Now, what about the letter?"<!-- Page 212 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXXVI"></a>CHAPTER XXXVI</h2>


<p>The motive of the actions taken that day by Eileen Meredith had been
accurately diagnosed by Heldon Foyle. She had returned to her home after
her visit to the police at Waterloo Bridge in a state of the keenest
uncertainty. Not for an instant did she credit the paragraph referring
to the dead body. The police had been able to read the cipher message
from Grell, and she assumed correctly enough that they had been more
successful than herself in obtaining an early glimpse of the
advertisement. What, then, had become of her note of warning?</p>

<p>She was half reclining in a big easy-chair, her arms resting on the
broad ledges, her fists tightly clenched. Her train of thought led her
to alarming conclusions. If the police had been watching&mdash;and that now
occurred to her as having been an obvious step&mdash;they must not only have
seen her note, but they might have secured and questioned the person who
brought the advertisement. And if so, might not Robert Grell's
hiding-place have been betrayed? Her heartbeats became unsteady. What if
the visit of the detectives down the river had been not to identify a
drowned corpse, but a living prisoner? Suppose Grell were already in
their hands?</p>

<p>She jumped to her feet. The watch on her wrist spoke to quarter to
eleven. Her reflections had occupied many hours. She was already dressed
in a brown<!-- Page 213 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span> walking costume, and she had not even removed her hat since
she returned. In answer to her summons a maid appeared with a cup of
coffee and a couple of biscuits on a tray. That reminded her that she
had not eaten since she had risen. She drank the coffee and ate the
biscuits, while waiting for the brougham she had ordered. Within a
quarter of an hour she was on her way to Scotland Yard.</p>

<p>In the circular hall, entered through swing-doors from the wide steps of
the main entrance, a uniformed policeman hurried forward to take her
card. Through the big windows she could see beneath her the surging life
of the Embankment and the smooth traffic of the river. Had the river
given up its secret? The constable returned, and she was ushered along a
grey and green corridor to Foyle's room. He had his overcoat on, and his
hat and stick lay on the table. He smiled a polite welcome at her, and
she strove to read his genial face without success. For her there was
something of humiliation in the situation. She, who had taken pains to
be offensive on the last occasion that they had met, was now dependent
upon his good-nature for the information she wanted.</p>

<p>"What can I do for you, Lady Eileen?" he asked with grave courtesy.</p>

<p>She had dropped into a chair and her grey eyes met his, half defiant,
half entreating. She answered with quick directness&mdash;</p>

<p>"You can tell me what has happened to Mr. Grell."</p>

<p>He opened his hands in a gesture of surprised expostulation. "My dear
young lady! I only wish we knew."<!-- Page 214 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span></p>

<p>Her foot tattooed impatiently on the floor. "Please don't treat me as if
I were a child, Mr. Foyle. Something has happened since yesterday
morning. I demand to know what it is."</p>

<p>Foyle was invariably gentle with women, and her insistent dignity rather
amused than angered him. "Since you demand it," he said suavely, laying
a scarcely perceptible stress on the word demand, "I will tell you. As
the result of certain information, observation has been kept on Lady
Eileen Meredith. She was followed yesterday to the advertisement offices
of the <i>Daily Wire</i>, where she made inquiries respecting a certain
cipher advertisement which was to appear in that paper. Failing to
obtain what she wanted, she left a note warning some one in the
following terms: 'The police know the cipher. Be very cautious. R.&nbsp;F. is
acting with them.'"</p>

<p>An angry flush swept across the girl's pale cheeks. "I know you have set
your spies about me," she said scornfully. "I did not come here to ask
you that. What&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"One moment. Let me finish. This morning Lady Eileen rose at an
unfashionable hour&mdash;about four, to be exact&mdash;and went out to obtain a
copy of the <i>Daily Wire</i>. Having deciphered the advertisement, and
finding that it afforded no direct clue to Grell's whereabouts, she
returned home and there came across a paragraph&mdash;which I will confess
was inspired in this office&mdash;that set her wondering whether, after all,
her lover was safe. She went out again&mdash;this time to Waterloo Bridge
police station&mdash;and there made some inquiries&mdash;&mdash;"<!-- Page 215 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span></p>

<p>Eileen had got to her feet. She was plainly angry. "I don't want to know
how effective your spying on a harmless woman can be."</p>

<p>"I am glad you admit it is effective," he answered quickly. "I wanted to
bring that home to you. You cannot or will not understand in how
perilous a situation you may find yourself if you go on playing with
fire. There is no one else who has fuller sympathy with you or greater
understanding of your feelings than I. Therefore I warn you. Do you know
that merely on what you have done and are doing I should, were I certain
that Grell was guilty, be justified in having you arrested as an
accessory after the fact?" His voice became very grave. "If your conduct
has not hampered this investigation, Lady Eileen, it has not been for
want of effort. Take the warning of a man who wishes you well. For
neither your position nor your friends will save you if ever you stand
in my way. I shall do my duty, whatever the consequences."</p>

<p>She was more impressed by his words and his tone than she would have
cared to admit. But except that her face became a shade paler, she gave
no indication that the warning touched her. Foyle had picked up his hat
and stick.</p>

<p>"You have not found him, then?" she cried. "Can it be doing you any harm
to say what has happened?"</p>

<p>"We have not found Grell&mdash;yet," he answered. "We found where he had been
hiding, but he got away."</p>

<p>A sigh of relief came from between her lips. She scarcely noticed the
abruptness with which he ended the interview, and returned his bow
almost with cordiality. Foyle only stayed long enough to thrust<!-- Page 216 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span> a few
papers into the safe, and then followed her out. Two resounding smacks
called his attention to the landing of the private stairs, where Chief
Detective-Inspector Green was struggling in the embrace of a stout,
matronly woman, while a half-suppressed snigger came from a passing
clerk.</p>

<p>Green, his solemn face crimson, pushed the woman gently away from him
towards a girl and a young man who were apparently waiting for her.
"There, there; that will do. Let us know if everything does all right.
Won't keep you a moment, sir," and he disappeared along the corridor.</p>

<p>When he returned he had recovered something of his usual impassivity.
But he could not be oblivious to the twinkle in Foyle's eyes. "Women are
the very devil," he said as if in answer. "There's no knowing what
they'll do. Now, the young girl there wanted to run away with a man of
fifty, who is already a married man. So her mother&mdash;the old lady you saw
kissing me&mdash;brought her up here, evidently under the impression that we
can do anything. I took the girl into my room and gave her some good
advice, telling her she had much better marry the young man you
saw&mdash;they had been engaged, and quarrelled&mdash;and I told of some cases
like her own that had come under my own knowledge. She wept a bit,
admitted I was right, and then suddenly flung herself on top of me and
started hugging and kissing me. I got her outside, told her mother that
the matter was all right, when I'm blessed if she didn't try it on too.
That was just as you came out. You may have noticed that I side-stepped
warily round the young man."<!-- Page 217 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span></p>

<p>"Be careful, Green. Is she a widow?" laughed Foyle. And then, more
seriously: "How far is it to this place? Our man may be out when we get
there."</p>

<p>"Shall we leave it till to-night, sir? It will be more certain then."</p>

<p>"No, we'll chance it. Let's have a look at the letter." He fished a note
out of his pocket and paused to read it through, carefully replacing it
in its envelope as he finished.</p>

<p>It was the letter that had been addressed to Floyd on the barge "Flowery
Land." It read&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Floyd</span>,&mdash;I have tried to carry out your instructions, but
luck has been against me, as I have to be very careful. It has been
easy enough to buy the seamen's discharges that you require, but I
have been unable to see Lola since she took the advertisement
to-day, so do not know if she has managed to raise money. I believe
I am fairly safe here, and my friends are to be relied upon, though
they are much occupied with the gambling and the smoke, so there is
not much quietness. If you write, address me as Mackirty, 146 Smike
Street, Shadwell."</p></blockquote>

<p>It had needed little penetration to identify the writer of the note as
Ivan, and to guess that he had taken refuge in a gambling and opium den.
Indeed, this latter fact was soon verified by a telephone appeal to the
detective-inspector in charge of the district, who declared that he was
only waiting for sufficient proof of the character of the house before
making a raid.<!-- Page 218 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span> Foyle had promptly ordered the place to be discreetly
surrounded, but that no steps were to be taken until his arrival. He had
conceived an admiration for Ivan's cunning in the matter, for there was
no place where a fugitive could be more certain of having the intrusion
of strangers more carefully guarded against than a gambling-house.</p>

<p>He was willing to forego a conviction against the keepers of the place
rather than miss an opportunity of securing Ivan. For cautious steps are
always necessary in proceeding against such places. It is so easy to
transform a game of baccarat, faro, or fantan into an innocent game of
bridge or whist with a few innocent spectators, and to hide all gambling
instruments between the time the police knock and the time they effect
an entry. Then, however positive the officers may be, they have no legal
proof, unless one of their number has been previously introduced as a
"punter," and to do that would require time.</p>

<p>Smike Street at one time had been a street of some pretensions. Even
now, in comparison with the neighbourhood in which it was set, it
maintained an air of genteel respectability, and its gloomy
three-storeyed houses had in many cases no more than one family to a
floor. It was, however, one of those back streets of the East End which
are never deserted, for its adult inhabitants plied trades which took
them abroad at all hours&mdash;market porters, street hawkers, factory
workers, dock labourers, seamen, all trades jostled here. One or two of
the houses bore a sign, "Hotel for Men Only."</p>

<p>It was at the corner that Foyle and Green were<!-- Page 219 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span> joined by the divisional
detective-inspector, and the three swung into the deserted saloon bar of
a shabby public-house which afforded a better opportunity for
unobtrusive conversation than the street. Leaving the glass of ale he
ordered untouched upon the counter, the superintendent rapidly learned
all steps that had been taken.</p>

<p>"It's a corner house on this side," said the local man, "kept by an old
scoundrel of a Chinaman calling himself Li Foo, and a man who was a bit
of a bruiser in San Francisco at one time&mdash;a chap called Keller. He
looks after the faro game in a back room on the first floor, while the
chink runs the black smoke upstairs on the stop storey. They're the
bosses, but there's three under-dogs, and the place is kept going night
and day."</p>

<p>Foyle grunted. "How long have you known this? Couldn't you have dropped
on 'em before?"</p>

<p>The other made a deprecatory gesture with his hands. "They're cunning.
The show had been running three months before we got wind of it. That
was about a month ago, and we've tried every trick in the bag to get one
of our men inside. There's no chance of rushing the place on a warrant
either, because both front and back doors are double, and only one man
is allowed to go in at a time. They won't open to two or more. Before we
could get the doors down there'd not be a thing left in the place as
evidence."</p>

<p>A gleam of temper showed in Foyle's blue eyes. "That's all very well,
Mr. Penny. It won't do to tell me that you've known of this place for a
month and<!-- Page 220 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span> that it is still carried on. Why didn't you let a man try
single-handed? With the door once open he could force his way in."</p>

<p>"I couldn't send a man on a job like that," protested the other. "Why,
you don't know the place. They'd murder him before we could get at him."</p>

<p>He flinched away from Foyle as though afraid his superior would strike
him. For the superintendent's hands were clenched and his eyes were
blazing. Yet when he spoke it was with dangerous quietness.</p>

<p>"A man of your experience ought to know by now that it's his business to
take risks. If you'd made up your mind there was no other way of
obtaining evidence you should have sent a man in. Never mind that now.
Take your orders from Mr. Green for the day. Green, I'll be back in an
hour. I'm going into that place. Act according to your own discretion if

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXXVII"></a>CHAPTER XXXVII</h2>


<p>The game of faro is one that makes no strenuous demands on the skill of
the players. It is chance pure and simple, and therein lies its
fascination. While baccarat or chemin-de-fer are almost invariably games
to be most in favour when the police raid a gambling-house in the West
End, at the other side of the town it is invariably discovered that faro
holds first place in the affections of gamblers. In its simplest form it
is merely betting on the turn of each card throughout a pack.</p>

<p>Although it was broad daylight, the room in which the operations took
place was shuttered and had the blinds drawn. A three-light gaselier
beat down on a big table in the centre of the room, round three sides of
which were ranged a dozen or fifteen men eagerly intent on the
operations of the banker. A heavy-jowled man with overhanging black
eyebrows, he was seated in a half-circle cut into the centre of one side
of the table. In front of him was a bright steel box sufficiently large
to contain a pack of cards with the face of the top card discernible at
an opening at the top. The cards were pressed upwards in the box by
springs, and at the side a narrow opening allowed the operator to push
the cards out one at a time, thus disclosing the faces of those
underneath and deciding the bets. On each side of the box were the
discarded winning and losing cards, and on the dealer's left a<!-- Page 222 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span> tray
which served the purpose of a till in receiving or paying out money. A
cloth with painted representations of the thirteen cards of a suit was
pinned to the table nearest to the players, and they placed stakes on
the cards they fancied would next be disclosed. Twice the box would
click out cards amid a dead silence. Those who had staked out money on
the first card disclosed won, those who had staked on the second lost.</p>

<p>There was often dead silence while the turn was being made, save for the
click of a marker shown on the wall and guarded by a thick-set little
man with red hair, fierce eyes, and an enormous chest. But directly
afterwards babel would break out, to be sternly quelled by the
heavy-jowled man.</p>

<p>"I 'ad set on sa nine," ... "Say, that king was coppered," ... "I ought
ter have split it."</p>

<p>The jargons of all the world met and crossed at such time. It was rarely
that there arose a serious quarrel, for Keller and his myrmidons had a
swift way of dealing with malcontents. When a man became troublesome,
the fierce-eyed little marker with the big chest would tap him on the
shoulder.</p>

<p>"That's enough, you," he would say menacingly.</p>

<p>If the warning were not sufficient the left hand of the little man would
drop to his jacket pocket, and when it emerged it would be decorated
with a heavy brass knuckle-duster. It took but one blow to make a man
lose all interest in the game, and thereafter he would be handed over to
the tender mercies of "Jim," a giant of a door-keeper, who after dark
would drop him into the street at some convenient moment, with<!-- Page 223 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span> a savage
warning to keep his mouth shut lest a worse thing befall him.</p>

<p>This was the place Heldon Foyle had made up his mind to enter
single-handed&mdash;a place in which the precautions against surprise were so
complete that every article which could be identified as a gambling
implement was made of material which could be readily burnt, or soluble
at a temperature lower than that of boiling water. A big saucepan was
continually simmering on the fire, so that the implements could be
dropped in it at a second's notice.</p>

<p>But Heldon Foyle had hopes. At the worst he could only fail. He returned
to Scotland Yard and shut himself up for twenty minutes in the make-up
room. When he reached Smike Street again he was no longer the spruce,
upright, well-dressed official. A grimy cap covered tousled hair. His
face was strained, his eyes bloodshot and his moustache combed out
raggedly. A set of greasy mechanic's overalls had been drawn over his
own clothes. He walked uncertainly.</p>

<p>Green and the local inspector saw him reel past the public-house in
which they still remained, as affording an excuse to be near the spot,
and reel up Smike Street. Towards the end he appeared confused and
gravely inspected several houses before approaching the gambling-joint.
He rapped on the door with his knuckles, ignoring both the knocker and
the bell. It opened a few inches wide, enough for the scowling face of
Jim the door-keeper to appear in the aperture.</p>

<p>Supporting himself with one hand on the door-post, Foyle leered amiably
at the Cerberus. "Hello, old sport, I want t'come in. Open the door,
can't you?"<!-- Page 224 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span></p>

<p>"Git out of it, you drunken swab. You don't live here," said Jim, taking
stock of the drunken intruder and coming to a quick decision.</p>

<p>The door slammed. Foyle beat a tattoo on the panels with his hands,
swaying perilously to and fro the while. Again the door opened the
cautious six inches, and Jim's face was not pleasant to look on as he
swore at the disturber.</p>

<p>"Tha'ss allri', ol' sport," hiccoughed Foyle. "I want to come in. A Bill
Reid tol' me if I wanted&mdash;hic&mdash;game I was to come here. You know ol'
Bill Reid"&mdash;this almost pleadingly&mdash;"he'll tell you I'm allri', eh?"</p>

<p>The door-keeper of the gaming-house holds an onerous responsibility. On
him depends the safety of the gamblers from interference by the
representatives of law and order. Jim's suspicions were lulled by
Foyle's quite obvious drunkenness. Nevertheless, a drunken man who had
apparently been told of the place was a danger so long as he remained
clamouring for admittance on the step. Jim tried tact.</p>

<p>"There's nothing doing now," he explained. "You go away and come back
to-night. It'll be a good game then."</p>

<p>"Tha'ss a lie," said Foyle, with an assumption of drunken gravity. "Old
Bill Reid he says to me, he says&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But Jim had lost the remainder of his small stock of patience. He jerked
the door again in Foyle's face, pulled off the chain and leapt out, his
intention of throwing the other into the street and so ending the
argument once for all written on every line of his stalwart figure.<!-- Page 225 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span></p>

<p>That was his programme. But Foyle had also his programme. He had got the
door open. All that remained between him and the entrance was the
muscular figure of Jim. He suddenly became sober. The door-keeper's hand
grasping at his collar clutched empty air. The detective's head dropped.
Jim was met half-way by a short charge and Foyle's shoulder caught him
in the chest. Both men were forced by the momentum of the charge back
through the open door and fell in a heap just within.</p>

<p>At ordinary times the two would have been fairly evenly matched. Both
were big men, though the door-keeper had slightly the advantage in size.
He had, however, been taken by surprise and received no opportunity to
utter more than a stifled oath before his breath was taken away. Inside
the house Foyle stood on no ceremony in order to silence his opponent
before those within could be alarmed. He had fallen on top of Jim.
Pressing down on him with head and knee, he swung his right fist twice.
Jim gave a grunt and his head rocked loosely on his neck. He had, in the
vernacular of the ring, been put to sleep.</p>

<p>The effects of a knockout blow, however deftly administered, do not last
long. The detective's first move was to close the street door, leaving
the bolts and chains undone, so that it was fastened merely by the
catches of the Yale locks. Then he whipped a handkerchief about the
unconscious man's mouth, and silently dragging him to a sitting posture,
handcuffed his wrists beneath his knees, so that he was trussed in the
position schoolboys adopt for cock-fighting. He surveyed his handiwork
critically, and, a new idea<!-- Page 226 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span> occurring to him, unlaced the man's boots,
and, taking them off, tied the laces round the ankles. That would
prevent the man rattling his boots on the floor when he came to, and so
have given the alarm.</p>

<p>The inner door had been left open by Jim, a lucky circumstance for
Foyle, as otherwise he would have been at a loss, for it was of stout
oak and he must have made considerable noise in forcing it. Yet he did
not make any attempt to soften his footsteps as he climbed the stairs.
He hoped to be taken as an ordinary client long enough, at any rate, to
discover the whereabouts of Ivan. Once that was achieved he was reckless
as to his identity becoming known.</p>

<p>He needed no guide to the right door, for the clink of money and the
exclamations of many voices guided him. He threw it open and entered the
faro room with quiet assurance. Beyond a quick glance from Keller no one
took any notice of him. They took it for granted that Jim had gone into
his <i>bona-fides</i> and that he was "square."</p>

<p>He took up a position at the end of the table nearest the door, and
apparently watched the game before staking. In reality he was studying
the faces of the players. He was uncertain whether he would find Ivan
there, but he had calculated that the Russian would at least be
watching, if not taking a hand, if only as a means of passing the time
during his voluntary imprisonment. And he was right. Seated at the table
two or three paces away was the Russian, lost to all save the turn of
the card.</p>

<p>Foyle bent over and staked a coin. At the same moment Ivan's eyes met
his in puzzled recognition.<!-- Page 227 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span> There was a crash and the gambler sprang
up, overturning the chair. His hand was outstretched, the finger
pointing at the detective.</p>

<p>"That man&mdash;how did he get in here?" he cried, with something like
alarm.<!-- Page 228 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXVIII" id="CHAPTER_XXXVIII"></a>CHAPTER XXXVIII</h2>


<p>For a second or a trifle more a dead silence followed Ivan's
denunciation. Heldon Foyle backed towards the door, dragging with him a
chair which he had clutched with some idea of using it as a shield
should there be a rush. There arose an angry snarl among the gamblers,
for with them suspicion was quick. A rush of crimson had swept across
Ivan's face at the first alarm. He ejaculated something excitedly in
Russian, and then went on in English&mdash;</p>

<p>"He is a police officer. I know him. It is the man Foyle of Scotland
Yard."</p>

<p>At the mention of the word police the hubble died down a little. Heldon
Foyle, leaning quietly on the back of the chair, took advantage of the
lull.</p>

<p>"Yes, I am a police officer," he admitted confidently. "The place is
surrounded. It will pay you to behave yourselves&mdash;you over there, put
that knife away, do you hear?"</p>

<p>The order was sharp and authoritative, and the Greek in whose hand the
detective had caught the gleam of steel thrust it back hastily into the
sheath at his belt. There were men there who would have thought little
of murder, and Foyle knew that once they were roused to fighting-pitch
he stood little chance. At the first sign of flinching on his part they
would be on him like a pack of wolves. He held them for the moment only,
as a lion-tamer holds his beasts under control<!-- Page 229 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>&mdash;by fearless domineering
assumption of authority. They were like a flock of sheep. Only two men
he feared&mdash;Ivan and Keller. Both were men above the average
intelligence, and both had more reason to fear the law than the others.
If either of them took the initiative he might be placed in an ugly
position. He felt for his whistle while they remained inactive,
uncertain.</p>

<p>"Let's teach the dog a lesson," hissed a venomous voice&mdash;that of Keller.
"He's trying to bluff us."</p>

<p>"Boot him, boys," incited Ivan, edging forward and so creating a
movement towards the detective.</p>

<p>Heldon Foyle put his whistle between his teeth and gripped the heavy
chair with both hands. As the rush came he blew the whistle three times
in the peculiar arrangement of long and short blasts that is the special
police call, and swung the chair down with all his force on the leading
man. It was Keller. The gaming-house keeper dropped, stunned, and the
detective swept the chair sideways and so forced a clear space about
himself. Again the whistle thrilled out, and Ivan dodging sideways
seized one of the legs of Foyle's unwieldy weapon. Menacing faces
besieged the detective on all sides. Other hands assisted the Russian to
hold the chair. And still no help came. Once the door opened and the
wrinkled leathern face of a Chinaman protruded through the slit, took in
the scene with quick understanding and disappeared. That was all the
notice taken of the row by the habitu&eacute;s of the opium den on the high
floor. The two or three clients who were stretched on the low couches
were either entirely under the influence of the drug or too listless<!-- Page 230 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span> to
worry about anything short of an earthquake&mdash;if even that would have
aroused them.</p>

<p>It was with small hope that the superintendent sounded his whistle
again. A heavy blow on the face laid open his cheek, and he saw the
little red-headed man who had slipped on his heavy brass knuckle-duster
dodge back into the crowd. He relinquished his hold of the chair and
defended himself with his hands. He carried a pistol in his pocket, but,
imbued with the traditions of the London police, he would not use a
lethal weapon save in the last extremity. Inch by inch he sidled along
the wall, fighting all the while until he reached the corner. Here the
crowd could only come at him from the front.</p>

<p>A knife was thrown and a bottle crashed against his shoulder. The crisis
had come. He dropped his guard and his hand closed over his pistol.
Those nearest to him recoiled as the muzzle was thrust into their faces.</p>

<p>"He daren't shoot," insisted a voice which Foyle recognised as that of
Ivan.</p>

<p>In fact, the gibe was partly true. The detective had himself well in
hand, and he knew that even though he were justified, a wounded man
would lead to an inquiry which at the very least would prevent his going
on with the Grell investigation for some time. But to let the taunt pass
would invite disaster. He dropped the weapon to his thigh, forefinger
extended along the barrel to help his aim, and pressed the trigger with
his second finger twice. The reports were deafening in the confined
space of the room, and one man put his hand to his head with a sharp
cry. He need not<!-- Page 231 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span> have disturbed himself, for the bullets had passed
over him and were buried in the opposite wall.</p>

<p>"We'll see whether I daren't fire," said Foyle grimly. "Come on. Who'd
like to be the first?"</p>

<p>There was no answer to his challenge, for from below came the sound of a
crash and the quick tread of many men racing up the stairs. One or two
of the gamblers turned white, and Foyle felt the tension of his nerves
relax. Half-a-dozen men, headed by Green and Penny, were rushing into
the room.</p>

<p>A little gurgling laugh burst from the superintendent, and he waved his
hand about the room. "You see, Penny, it could be done, single-handed.
That is Ivan over there. Take good care of him, Green. Keller is that
man knocked out down there." And, swaying, he crashed forward to the
floor in a dead faint.</p>

<p>When he came round he was lying on a couch with his injured face and
shoulder neatly bandaged. There were only two other persons in the room,
Green and one of the local detectives, who were systematically making an
inventory of everything in the room. The superintendent struggled to a
sitting position and the movement brought Green to his side.</p>

<p>"Hello, Green," said the superintendent cheerfully. "You've got 'em all
away, I see. How long have I been lying here?"</p>

<p>"Matter of half an hour. It's only a case of loss of blood, I think. You
must have been bleeding for some time before we broke in on the
tea-party. We put some first-aid bandages on."</p>

<p>"I'm all right," said Foyle, rising stiffly. "What<!-- Page 232 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span> happened? You were a
deuce of a time answering my whistle."</p>

<p>"We tried the wrong door first, and it's my belief that nothing short of
dynamite would move it. It's steel-lined, and with all the bolts pushed
home we stood no chance. We gave it up after awhile and tried the other.
Luckily that was not bolted."</p>

<p>"I know. I left it like that purposely."</p>

<p>"Well, we didn't know. By that time we got thirty uniform men down here,
and they followed us up. Once we got the door down and found the chap
you'd trussed behind it, we had no trouble worth mentioning except with
Master Ivan, who fought like a wild cat. We got the cuffs on him at
last, but even then it took four men to get him away. Penny is down at
the station waiting till you come before charging 'em. What is it to be?
Attempt to murder?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't think we can get a conviction on that," answered Foyle.
"There's plenty up against them&mdash;unlawful wounding, assaulting a police
officer in the execution of his duty, frequenting a gaming-house, and,
of course, Ivan could be charged with the Waverley affair if we find it
necessary now. I see you've started running over the house."</p>

<p>"Only just started. We are waiting for the divisional surgeon to see to
you and three men who are sleeping like logs in the opium-joint
upstairs. The Chinaman seems to have vanished&mdash;at any rate, he can't be
found. It's just about time this place was broken up. Keller took no
chances with the bank." He picked up the faro-box. "Now, in the States
this<!-- Page 233 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span> kind of thing would not go. It's a two-card needle-tell swindle."</p>

<p>"That's done with fifty-four cards to the pack, isn't it?" asked Foyle
indifferently, handling the box. "I've seen something like it before.
The dealer is warned of the approach of duplicate cards by a tiny
needle-point jumping out of one side of the box."</p>

<p>"That's it."</p>

<p>"Well, all that will have to be explained when the case comes on for
trial. I'm more interested in Ivan just now. It's something to have him
under lock and key. I'll leave you here to handle the remainder of the
business and get down to the station. No&mdash;I'll not wait for the doctor.
I feel perfectly fit now."</p>

<p>In spite of his assertion the superintendent felt a little dizzy when he
reached the open air. A big crowd filled the street, and a dozen
reporters who had been held sternly at bay by the constables on duty at
the gambling-house pounced on him determinedly. He laughingly waved them
aside, but they would not be denied, and while they walked at his side
gave a succinct account of what had happened, omitting all reference to
Ivan Abramovitch.</p>

<p>"New thing for you to come all the way to the East End to take charge of
a gambling raid, isn't it?" asked Jerrold, the <i>Wire</i> man, in a tone
that told of a shrewd suspicion of something underlying.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's been an experience," said Foyle lightly, indicating his
bandaged head. "I've told you everything I know now, boys. If there's
anything else you can use, I'll have it at the Yard presently. So-long."</p>

<p>The journalists melted away, and Foyle presently<!-- Page 234 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span> found himself in a
dingy back street where the local police station was situated. Here also
a crowd of men and women had gathered, and the reserve men at the door
were repelling eager women who, not knowing who had been taken in the
raid, feared that their husbands might be included and were anxious to
know the worst; for news of that kind spreads rapidly.</p>

<p>A motor-car standing without told the superintendent of Sir Hilary
Thornton's presence. And the Assistant Commissioner was the first person
he saw as he entered the place. Thornton came forward with hand
outstretched.</p>

<p>"Thank God, Foyle! We had a rumour at the Yard that you had been badly
hurt. I see you've been knocked about a bit. What made you take a hand
yourself down here? Couldn't you leave a raid to be carried out by the
local folk?"</p>

<p>"I didn't come down here specially for that reason," smiled the
superintendent. "I wanted to get hold of Ivan Abramovitch, and
everything else was purely incidental."</p>

<p>"They're waiting for you to settle who shall be charged with what," said
Thornton. "Be as quick as you can, and I'll wait and give you a lift
back in the car. I'll not be happy till I've heard all about this."</p>

<p>The two passed into the charge-room, where Penny was in conversation
with the superintendent of the division. In reply to a question, he
thought for a little.</p>

<p>"We've got eighteen men in all, sir," he answered. "It would have been
fifty if we'd been able to bring our coup off at night."<!-- Page 235 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span></p>

<p>"Very well. Have 'em all in except Abramovitch and Keller. I will pick
out those I want charged with assault, or who I think were mixed up with
Keller. The remainder might be let out on bail after you have verified
their addresses."</p>

<p>The prisoners were ushered into the room, a shame-faced, sullen,
dispirited gang now. Penny and a clerk passed along the line, taking
their names, while Foyle scrutinised their faces. Finally, the
superintendent touched four men on the shoulder one after the other. One
was Jim, the door-keeper; another the red-haired man with the big chest;
the third and fourth two men who had been prominent in the attack. Penny
put a tick against their names, and the whole of the prisoners, many of
whom had broken into voluble protest and appeal, were taken back to the
cells. Foyle had determined to leave the business of charging them to
Green and Penny.<!-- Page 236 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXIX" id="CHAPTER_XXXIX"></a>CHAPTER XXXIX</h2>


<p>Something of the chagrin caused to Heldon Foyle by the escape of the man
on the barge had vanished with the success of his operations in Smike
Street. If his frontal attack had failed, he had at least achieved
something by his flank movement. The break-up of the gambling-den, too,
was something. Altogether he felt that his injuries were a cheap price
to pay for what had been achieved.</p>

<p>In bare detail he related the sequence of events to Sir Hilary Thornton,
who, with a gloved hand jerking at his grey moustache, listened with
only an occasional observation.</p>

<p>The inevitable crowd of journalists, who had been warned by telephone
from their colleagues at Smike Street, were jumbled in a tiny, tiny
waiting-room when Foyle and his superior reached headquarters. The
superintendent, having changed his attire, made it his first business to
satisfy their clamorous demands by dictating a brief and discreet
account of the raid, to be typed and handed out to them, then with a
head that ached intolerably he forced himself to do some clear thinking.</p>

<p>With the dossier of the case before him, he read and re-read all that
had been gathered by his men and himself since that night when he had
been called from his sleep to find Harry Goldenburg dead. Was there some
point he had overlooked? He knew how fatal<!-- Page 237 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span> it was in the work of
criminal investigation to take anything for granted. Although the main
work of the explorer was now focused on Grell, it was not entirely
certain that he was the murderer. Indeed, strange as his proceedings had
been, there might be some explanation that would account for them. It
might be that after Grell was found the whole investigation would have
to begin again with the scent grown cold. Stranger things had happened.</p>

<p>The superintendent dropped his papers wearily into a drawer and turned
the key. His speculations were unprofitable. He turned over in his brain
his plans for running down Grell. Of the people who had been assisting
him to evade capture three were out of the way for the time being. Ivan
Abramovitch and Condit were safely under lock and key. The Princess
Petrovska was out of London, and there was a fair margin of assumption
that she was located somewhere in Liverpool, where the local police were
assisting the Scotland Yard men. It was hardly possible that she would
double back, even if she evaded their rigorous search. With the
detectives on duty at the London termini reinforced and on strict watch,
her chances of doing so were very slim.</p>

<p>With three of his friends out of touch, and hampered by want of money,
Grell would have to seek a fresh refuge. The chief result of Foyle's
actions had been to make any steps he might take more difficult. That
was all. It was still possible for him to dodge the pursuit.</p>

<p>The evening papers with the story of the raid were already upon the
streets. What would be the effect<!-- Page 238 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span> upon Grell's plans when he learned
that Ivan had been captured? In the case of an ordinary criminal, Heldon
Foyle might have forecasted what would happen with a fair degree of
certainty. But Grell was not an ordinary criminal, even if he were a
criminal at all. If he could gain a hint of the possible intentions of
the fugitive he might be able to meet them.</p>

<p>There was a vague chance that either Ivan Abramovitch or Condit might be
induced to volunteer a statement, although the possibility was remote.
In America or France there would have been ways of forcing them to
speak. In England it was impossible.</p>

<p>With a yawn Foyle relinquished his efforts, and his head dropped forward
on his desk. In a little he was fast asleep. He was roused by a light
touch on the shoulder. Green had returned.</p>

<p>"Hello!" said the superintendent. "I must have dozed off. How have you
got on?"</p>

<p>Green adjusted his long body to the comfort of an arm-chair. "We found
the Chinaman. He'd climbed through a trap-door on to the roof. We went
over the house with a tooth-comb, both before and after I'd had a little
talk with Keller. It seems that both he and his partner the Chinaman had
known the man for some time before they gave him a room. They're old
hands at the game and won't talk too much. He went out very
occasionally, and mostly at night. We found nothing bearing on the
murder, but plenty to show that Keller and his pal were running a pretty
hot shop."</p>

<p>"H'm! could you dig anything out of any of the others? There was the
door-keeper."</p>

<p>"No. Tight as oysters, all except those who don't<!-- Page 239 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span> know anything. Ivan
has a fit of the sulks. He's called in Mordix to help him fix up his
defence."</p>

<p>The superintendent was rubbing his chin. "Mordix isn't too scrupulous. I
think we'll hold over the charge of abduction for the time being until
we see how things look. Nobody hurt much, I suppose?"</p>

<p>The saturnine features of the inspector wrinkled into as near a grin as
they were capable of. "Some of them are rather sore, but the doctor
thinks they can all appear in court to-morrow."</p>

<p>Foyle stretched himself and rose. "Right. We won't worry any further
about it for the moment. I'm feeling that the best thing for me is a
good night's rest. You'd better go home and do the same. Good night."<!-- Page 240 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XL" id="CHAPTER_XL"></a>CHAPTER XL</h2>


<p>A note came to Sir Ralph Fairfield while he was lingering over his
breakfast, and the first sight of the writing, even before he broke open
the envelope, caused a thrill to run through him.</p>

<p>"You must see me at once," said the well-remembered writing
imperatively. "Urgent, urgent!"</p>

<p>The paper trembled in Fairfield's hands, and it was only the reminder of
the servant that the messenger was waiting that brought him sharply out
of his daze.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes. Show him in. And, Roberts, while I am engaged I don't want to
be disturbed by anybody or anything. Don't forget that."</p>

<p>If Roberts had not been so well trained it was possible that he might
have shown surprise at his master's order. For through the door he held
open there shambled an ungainly figure of a man, hunchbacked, with a
week's growth of beard about his chin, and wearing heavy, patched boots,
corduroys, a shabby jacket and a bright blue muffler. His cap he twisted
nervously in gnarled, dirty hands as he stood waiting just inside the
room till he was certain that the servant had retired out of hearing.</p>

<p>Then, with a swift movement, he locked the door, straightened himself
out, and strode with outstretched hand to where Fairfield stood,
stony-faced and impassive. The baronet deliberately put his hands behind
him, and the other halted suddenly.</p>

<p>"Fairfield!"<!-- Page 241 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span></p>

<p>Then it was that the impassivity of Sir Ralph vanished. He gripped his
visitor by the arm, almost shaking him in a gust of quick, nervous
passion.</p>

<p>"You fool&mdash;you damned fool! Why have you come here? If they catch you,
you will be hanged. Do you know that? For all I know the place is
watched. They may have seen you come in. Perhaps the place is surrounded
now."</p>

<p>"I'll risk it," said the other coolly, drawing a chair up to the table.
"I've got to risk something. But I don't think they saw me come in. I
don't think they'll catch me, and if they do I don't think they'll hang
me. What do you think of that, Fairfield?"</p>

<p>There was the old languid mockery in his voice, but his friend, looking
at him closely, could see that the face had become a trifle thinner,
that beneath the dirt that begrimed it there were haggard traces that
betrayed worry and sleeplessness. Fairfield had thought much of Robert
Grell lately, but he had never dreamed that the hunted man would come to
him&mdash;come to him in broad daylight, without a word of warning. Did Grell
know that he was in touch with the police? Had he come, a driven,
desperate man, to fling reproaches at the friend who had joined in the
hunt? That was unlikely. Grell, murderer or not, was not that type. He
did nothing without a reason. He was, Fairfield reflected, a murderer&mdash;a
murderer who had not dared stay to face the consequences of his deed.
That surely severed all claims, whatever their old friendship might have
been.</p>

<p>"What do you want?" he asked, with a hard note in his voice. "Why have
you come to me?"<!-- Page 242 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span></p>

<p>The man in the chair lifted his shoulders.</p>

<p>"That is fairly obvious. I want you to do what, if our situations were
reversed, I would do for you. I want money. If you can get me a few
hundreds I shall be all right."</p>

<p>A spasm contracted Fairfield's face for a second. He had not asked for
explanations. Grell had volunteered none. It seemed as though he were
taking for granted the assumption that he was guilty of the murder.
Surely an innocent man would have been eager to assert his innocence at
the first opportunity. When Sir Ralph answered, it was slowly, as though
he were weighing each word that he spoke. "I would be willing enough to
help a friend&mdash;you know that, Grell. But why you should think I would
lift a finger to help you evade justice I fail to see. I know enough of
the law to know that I should become an accessory to the fact."</p>

<p>"You really think I killed that man?" The words came quick and sharp,
like a pistol shot. "I thought you had known me long enough&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Words," interrupted Fairfield bitterly. "All words. You were the last
man I should have thought capable of such a thing; but all the facts are
against you. Need I go over them? Let me tell you that if ever a jury
knows what Scotland Yard knows and you stand in the dock, no earthly
power can save you. If that crime is on your conscience it seems to rest
lightly enough."</p>

<p>Grell stood up and rested one hand lightly on the sleeve of his
companion. "Fairfield, old chap," he said earnestly, "we have been
through enough together<!-- Page 243 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span> to prove to you that I am not a coward. I swear
on my honour that I had nothing to do with that man's death&mdash;though I
have had reason enough to wish him dead, God knows. Do you think it is
fear for myself that has driven me into hiding?"</p>

<p>Fairfield shook his head impatiently, and shaking himself clear paced
quickly up and down the room. "That's all very well, Grell," he said
more mildly, "but it is hardly convincing in the face of facts. You
disappear immediately after the murder, having got me to lie to cover
your retreat, and the next I hear from you is when you want money. It's
too thin. If I were you I should go now. For the sake of old times I
will say nothing about your visit here, but to help you by any other
means&mdash;no. If you had no hand in that murder, come out like a man and
make a fight for it. I will back you up."</p>

<p>"Thanks." There was a dry bitterness in Grell's tone that did not escape
Sir Ralph. "I couldn't have got better advice if I'd gone to Scotland
Yard itself." His voice changed to a certain quality of harshness. "Look
here, Fairfield. Suppose I do know something about this business;
suppose I know who Harry Goldenburg was, and how and why he was killed;
suppose I had stayed while inquiries were being made, then I should
either have to have betrayed a friend or taken the burden on my own
shoulders; suppose I say I was honest that night when I asked you to
conceal my absence from the St. Jermyn's Club; that I did nothing which
I would not do over again"&mdash;he banged his fist on the table and his eyes
glowed fiercely&mdash;"I tell you I have had no choice in this matter. Even
you,<!-- Page 244 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span> who know me as well as any man, do not know what I had been
through until that man lay dead. Since then I have suffered hell. The
police have been at my heels ever since. I carried little enough money
away with me, and I dared not attempt to change a cheque while I was
thought to be dead." He drew a gold watch from his pocket. "I dare not
even pawn this, for even the pawnbrokers are watched. They stopped all
my efforts to raise money in other directions, and have isolated me from
my friends. I have fifteen shillings left, and yet since they routed me
out of cover the day before yesterday I have not dared get a lodging for
fear that I might arouse suspicion. I slept on the Embankment last
night."</p>

<p>He paused, breathless from his own vehemence. Fairfield had seen him in
moments of danger, yet never had he seen him so roused out of himself.
He could see one of the sinewy hands actually trembling, and that alone
was proof enough of the violence of the hunted man's emotion. He went to
a side table, and pouring out a generous dose of brandy from a decanter,
squirted a little soda-water in it and handed it to Grell. But his face
was still hard and set.</p>

<p>"Drink that," he said. And then, as the other obeyed: "It is no use
fencing with the question, Grell. If you want me to help you you will
have to give some explanation. I am not going to dip my hands in this
business blindly. Don't think it's a matter of you and I simply. This
concerns Eileen."</p>

<p>Grell put down his empty glass and stared into the other's eyes.<!-- Page 245 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ah yes, Eileen," he said quietly. "What about her?"</p>

<p>"This," Fairfield spoke tensely, "that if you are guilty you have ruined
her life; if you are innocent and cannot prove it you might as well be
guilty. I'll not conceal from you that I have given Scotland Yard some
measure of assistance in trying to find you. Do you know why? Because I
judged you to be a man. Because I thought that if put to it you might
prove your innocence or take the only course that could spare her the
degradation of seeing the man she loved convicted as a murderer."</p>

<p>A grim unmirthful smile parted Robert Grell's lips. He understood well
enough what was meant. "You always were a good friend, Fairfield," he
retorted. "Perhaps you have a revolver you could lend me."</p>

<p>"Will you use it if I do?" burst impulsively from Fairfield's white
lips. He was sincere in his suggestion. To his mind there was only one
escape from the predicament in which his friend found himself. Anything
was preferable, in his mind, to the open scandal of public trial.</p>

<p>"Don't be a fool," said Grell, making a gesture as though waving the
subject aside. "I shall not commit suicide&mdash;at any rate, while I've got
a fighting chance. Let's get to the point. Will you lend me some money?"</p>

<p>The clear-cut face of Fairfield had gone very pale. When he answered it
was with dry lips and almost in a whisper.</p>

<p>"Not a farthing." And then with more emphasis&mdash;"Not a farthing."</p>

<p>A mist was before his eyes. The lock of the door<!-- Page 246 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span> clicked and Grell
shambled out. For ten minutes or more Ralph Fairfield remained, his
fingers twitching at the buttons of his waistcoat. A revulsion of
feeling had come. Had he done right? Was Grell's course the wisest,
after all? How had his own feelings towards Eileen influenced him in his
decision not to help the man who had been his friend?</p>

<p>He resolved to try to shake the matter from his mind, and his hand
sought the bell-push. Twice he rang without receiving any reply, and he
flung open the door and called imperatively&mdash;</p>

<p>"Roberts!"</p>

<p>Still his man failed to answer. He walked quickly through all the rooms
that constituted his apartments. There was no trace of the missing
servant. A quick suspicion tugged at his brain, and he wondered why he
had not thought of it before. Of course, Roberts knew Grell, but the
disguise of the explorer was not absolutely impenetrable. In spite of
his clothes, his missing moustache, and his tousled hair dyed black,
Fairfield had known him. Why not the servant? And if Roberts had
recognised him and was missing&mdash;</p>

<p>Fairfield began to hurriedly put on an overcoat.<!-- Page 247 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XLI" id="CHAPTER_XLI"></a>CHAPTER XLI</h2>


<p>The police court proceedings in connection with the gambling-joint in
Smike Street had opened satisfactorily so far as the police were
concerned. All the prisoners but the principals and those involved in
the attack on Heldon Foyle had been subjected to small fines, and were,
as the legal phrase goes, "bound over." The remainder had been remanded
for a week at the request of the prosecuting solicitor, a half-hearted
request for bail being refused.</p>

<p>For the first time since he had attained the rank of superintendent,
Foyle himself had gone into the witness-box. That was unavoidable, as he
was the only man who could give direct evidence of the character of the
house. Hitherto he had arranged so that the court work fell on his
subordinates while he gave his attention to organisation and
administrative detail; for the giving of evidence is only the end of the
work of a detective. There are men behind the scenes in most cases that
come into the criminal courts who are never told off, happenings never
referred to. They are summed up in the phrase "Acting on information
received, I&mdash;&mdash;" The business of a detective is to secure his prisoner
and give evidence, not to tell how it was done.</p>

<p>"Still no news from Liverpool," said the superintendent as he left the
court with Green. "I begin<!-- Page 248 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span> to wish I'd sent you down there. That woman
has got the knack of vanishing."</p>

<p>"Yes," agreed his lieutenant, producing a well-worn brier and pressing
the tobacco down with a horny thumb. "And yet people think we've got an
easy job. Lola knows her business, and I'm open to bet she'll not be
found before she wants to be found."</p>

<p>Foyle chuckled at this enunciation of rank heresy. Only a veteran of
Green's experience would have dared question the ability of Scotland
Yard to maintain a scent once picked up. The superintendent did not take
the pessimism too seriously. In theory it is not difficult for one
person to disappear among forty millions, but to remain hidden
indefinitely, in the face of a vigorous, sustained search by men trained
to their business is not so simple in practice.</p>

<p>"You've got a habit of looking on the worst side of things," he laughed.
"I've never known us want any one we knew badly but what we got 'em at
last. Besides, Blake's down there, and he's a good man. He's got a
personal interest in running her down now."</p>

<p>"H'm," commented Green, in the tone of one not entirely convinced, and
lapsed into a stolid silence which would have irritated some men, but
merely amused the superintendent.</p>

<p>They separated at the door of Foyle's room at headquarters, and an
impatient detective-sergeant, whose duty it was to weed out callers,
promptly headed Heldon Foyle off.</p>

<p>"A man's been waiting to see you, sir," he said. "He refused to give his
name, but said he had some important information which he would only
give to you<!-- Page 249 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span> personally. He wouldn't hear of seeing any one else."</p>

<p>"Yes, of course. They've all got important information, and they all
want to see me personally&mdash;or else the Commissioner. Well, where is he,
Shapton? Show him in."</p>

<p>"I can't. He's gone, sir. He'd been waiting here half an hour or so when
he was taken away by Sir Ralph Fairfield."</p>

<p>If he had not been trained to school his feelings, Heldon Foyle might
have started. As it was, he picked up a pen and toyed idly with it. The
man, who had a fair idea that his news was of importance, was a little
disappointed.</p>

<p>"I see," said the superintendent. "What happened?"</p>

<p>"Why, Sir Ralph asked to see you and was shown into the waiting-room
with the other man. They both seemed a bit upset, and the first chap's
jaw dropped. 'So you are here,' says Sir Ralph, a bit angrily. 'Yes,
sir,' says the other, and he had become sulky. 'This is my man,' says
Sir Ralph to me, 'and I would like a word with him alone, if you don't
mind.' Of course, I left 'em alone. In a quarter of an hour they came
out, and Sir Ralph told me that there had been a little
misunderstanding&mdash;that neither of them wished to see you after all."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Shapton," said the superintendent, resting his chin on his
hand. "Ask Mr. Green if he can spare a moment, will you?"</p>

<p>In the interval that elapsed before the chief inspector came, Foyle did
some quick thinking. Criminal investigation is always full of unexpected
developments,<!-- Page 250 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span> and this seemed to him to offer possibilities. It was
clear to him that a man had come to Scotland Yard to give some
information, and that Fairfield had followed post-haste to shut the
man's mouth. For the moment he put aside all speculation as to the
baronet's motive. The question was, who was the man he had taken away?
Who would be likely to know something? It must be some one intimately
associated with the baronet, some one who probably lived with him. There
was only one man&mdash;his servant.</p>

<p>The line of reasoning became clear. What would a servant know which he
would recognise as of obvious importance? Fairfield might have received
a letter from Grell, but if he did not wish to let the police know of
it, he would scarcely have been careless enough to leave it where his
man might have obtained access to it. The second solution was more
probable. Suppose Grell had paid a visit to Fairfield and the man had
recognised him?</p>

<p>Foyle was not led away by theories. He knew that the most ingenious
deductions often led to failure. But in this case he had nothing to lose
by putting the matter to the test. He had not taken off his hat or coat,
and when Green came in he was ready to put his plan into execution. In a
few words he told what had happened and his conclusions.</p>

<p>"What I want you to do, Green, is to ring up Fairfield and get him out
of the way on some pretext. Keep him here till I come back. I'm going to
have a talk with that servant. If you can't get him on the 'phone,
you'll have to go round and get him out somehow. I want a good man whom
he doesn't know to<!-- Page 251 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span> come to the Albany with me. Give me a chance to get
there before you ring up."</p>

<p>"Very good, sir. Maxwell is free. I'll tell him you want him."</p>

<p>In a quarter of an hour Maxwell, an unobtrusive, well-dressed man, had
taken up his station and was casually loitering where he could see all
who entered or emerged from the Albany. Foyle himself was out of view,
but he had a fine sight of his subordinate. Ten minutes elapsed. The
well-dressed detective dropped the stick he was listlessly swinging
between his fingers, and Foyle knew that Sir Ralph had risen to the
bait. It remained to be found out whether the servant was still in the
chambers.</p>

<p>Waiting just long enough for Fairfield to get a reasonable distance
away, Foyle was whirled up in the lift to the baronet's rooms. His first
pressure on the bell remained unanswered, but at a second and longer
ring he was confronted by the upright figure of Roberts. The servant
gave a little gasp of astonishment as he saw his visitor.</p>

<p>"Sir Ralph is out, sir," he stammered.</p>

<p>"Yes, I know," said the detective pleasantly. "I did not come here to
see Sir Ralph, but to see you. You know who I am. Let me in, won't you?"</p>

<p>He pushed his way into the place and entered the sitting-room, Roberts
following closely behind him. The man was evidently very nervous. Foyle
sat down.</p>

<p>"Now, my man, you needn't feel nervous. Your master won't be back yet
awhile. You came to my office to see me this morning, and left before I
got<!-- Page 252 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span> back. I've come to see what this important information you've got
for me is."</p>

<p>Roberts shifted his weight from one foot to the other and rubbed his
hands together nervously. His eyes never met the superintendent's. "It's
all a mistake," he asserted unsteadily. "I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That won't do, my man," said Foyle brusquely. "You know something which
it is important I should know. Sir Ralph has told you to keep your mouth
shut. But you're going to tell me before either of us leaves this room.
I want you to speak now. Never mind about thinking of a lie."</p>

<p>His blunt manner had its effect. Roberts drew himself together. "Right,
sir, I'll tell you what I came about. You're a gentleman and won't see
me a loser. Sir Ralph, he promised to look after me if I kept my mouth
shut."</p>

<p>It is no part of a detective's duty to allow personal feelings to
interfere with his business. Foyle's contempt for a man who was ready to
bargain to betray his master's confidence was sunk in his content at so
easily obtaining his ends. "That will be all right," he answered.
"You'll be paid according to the value of your information."</p>

<p>"Then it's this, sir," blurted out Roberts. "Mr. Grell, whom you thought
was murdered, is not dead. He came here an hour or two ago, and was in
with Sir Ralph for quite a time."</p>

<p>"Oh." The detective smiled incredulously, and snapping open his
cigar-case selected a smoke, nipped off the end, and deliberately struck
a match. "You've got hold of some cock-and-bull idea. I sup<!-- Page 253 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>pose you've
deceived yourself with some fancied resemblance."</p>

<p>"It was Mr. Grell himself, I tell you," averred the servant earnestly.
"Don't I know him well enough? He was roughly dressed and had shaved off
his moustache, but I'm certain of it. He came up by the lift as large as
life with a note for Sir Ralph. I didn't notice him much at first,
because I thought he was a street messenger. But when Sir Ralph told me
to bring him in I had a good look at him. I knew I had seen him before,
but the change in him threw me off for a while. It was only after I left
him with Sir Ralph that it came on me like a shot. I knew that there was
a reward out in connection with the murder, and I came on to you at
once. If you had been in I should have told you all this then, but Sir
Ralph came after me and promised to pay me well to keep my tongue
between my teeth. But right is right, sir, and I hope you'll do what you
can for me. For I'll take my dying oath that the man I saw here was Mr.
Grell."</p>

<p>With calm, expressionless face Foyle listened. His inferences were
justified. It would be necessary to keep Roberts from gossipping, and
for that reason it was policy to discount the importance of his
information. The detective puffed a cloud of smoke to the ceiling.</p>

<p>"You seem pretty sure of yourself. I think you've made a mistake, but
we'll go into the thing fully and you'll get whatever your information
is worth. How long was this chap in with your master?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. I didn't see him come out. He<!-- Page 254 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span> had been in there about
ten minutes when I started out to see you."</p>

<p>"Right. Now I'm going to wait here till your master comes back. You can
deny that I have questioned you, or that you have told me anything, if
you like. I shan't give you away. Where's the telephone?"</p>

<p>With a little breath of relief the servant conducted Foyle to an inner
room and pointed out the instrument. A few seconds sufficed to put the
superintendent in communication with Green, and in a quick, low-voiced
conversation he was told what device had been practised to keep Sir
Ralph away.</p>

<p>"I'll let him go now, then?" said Green, and his superior assented.</p>

<p>When Sir Ralph Fairfield returned to his chambers, he found Heldon Foyle
seated before the fire engrossed in a paper and with his feet stretched
out to the cheerful blaze.</p>

<p>"Good morning, Sir Ralph," said the detective, rising. "I just dropped
in as I was near here to tell you how things were progressing, and to
see if you'd got any news."<!-- Page 255 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XLII" id="CHAPTER_XLII"></a>CHAPTER XLII</h2>


<p>But that his breath came a little faster, Fairfield gave no sign of the
perturbation that Heldon Foyle's presence caused him. That the summons
to Scotland Yard had been a pretext to get him out of the way was now
obvious. The only question was whether Roberts had divulged anything to
the detective during his absence.</p>

<p>It was quite impossible to allow Grell's visit to him to be used in the
investigation. That was not in the bargain with Foyle. Innocent or
guilty, his friend had trusted him, and to use that trust to hound him
down would savour of treachery. There was no doubt that Foyle knew
something. He wondered how much.</p>

<p>He returned his visitor's greeting. "Always glad to see you, Mr. Foyle,
though I'm afraid there's nothing fresh so far as I am concerned. I see
my man's made you comfortable. There's been a mistake somewhere. I've
been to Scotland Yard waiting for you."</p>

<p>His head was in the shadow and Foyle could not see his face. He could
not be sure whether the words were a challenge, and made a little
gesture with his hand.</p>

<p>"That's a pity," he said. "Things have got muddled up somehow. However,
now we're here it's all right. By the way, we narrowly missed laying our
hands on Grell an hour or two ago."</p>

<p>Although he was staring placidly into the fire he did not fail to note
the quick start that the baronet gave.<!-- Page 256 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span> And it was not a feigned start.
Fairfield could not understand this indirect method of attack.</p>

<p>"What!" he stammered. "You nearly arrested him?"</p>

<p>"It was touch and go," said Foyle languidly. "Some of our men got on his
trail and followed him until he reached here. They never saw him come
out."</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say that Grell has been here&mdash;here to-day?" demanded
Fairfield, putting as bold a face on the matter as was possible.</p>

<p>"I do," said Foyle quietly.</p>

<p>"Without my knowledge?"</p>

<p>Heldon Foyle shook his head, and thrusting his hands into his jacket
pockets faced the baronet squarely. "That's what I want to know. Was it
without your knowledge, Sir Ralph?"</p>

<p>Fairfield met that searching gaze unflinchingly. There was a touch of
hauteur in his tone when he replied, "Do you suggest that I am hiding
him?"</p>

<p>Had Foyle not been sure of his facts the manner of the baronet might
have convinced him that he was in error. As it was, he ignored the
evasion. It was essential to know whether the fugitive had been supplied
with any money and whether he had given any indication of his plans. "I
feel quite certain that you have had a talk with him lately," he said.
"I thought you were going to do what you could to help us clear up this
mystery. Why deny a fact that is plain?"</p>

<p>Sir Ralph clenched his teeth. It was clear that Foyle was certain of his
ground; that it was no use any longer trying to throw dust in his eyes.
"Well?" he demanded icily. "I suppose I am not entirely a spy<!-- Page 257 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span> at your
disposal, Mr. Foyle. I am like most men, I have my limits. I prefer to
remain master of my own actions."</p>

<p>"I should be the last to dispute it," said Foyle, with a slight bow, "or
to take advantage of the good-nature that has led you to assist us
hitherto. Of course you could not foresee that Grell would come to you,
and you naturally do not want to take advantage of his confidence. But
we already know of his visit, so there is no breach of trust there. All
I ask is that you should simplify the matter by telling me what occurred
at your interview. Perhaps you have forgotten, Sir Ralph, that there is
a punishment for assisting a man to escape&mdash;by lending him money or
otherwise. That is merely for information. It is not a threat."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said the other. "It would make no difference to me whether
it was a threat or not." He remained in thought for a moment. The fact
that Grell had entered the place and apparently got clear away had led
him to believe that the police knew nothing of the visit, that the only
risk of the interview being disclosed lay with Roberts. If the
detectives had really been close on the heels of the fugitive, as Foyle
said, it could do no harm to admit the truth. His promise to say nothing
could hardly be considered to cover the contingency. "Has Roberts been
talking to you?" he asked abruptly.</p>

<p>"Roberts?" repeated the superintendent, with a puzzled frown. "Oh, of
course, he's your servant. I asked him one or two questions, but he
didn't seem to understand me."</p>

<p>The answer was so quick, so naturally given, that<!-- Page 258 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span> any suspicion that
remained in Fairfield's mind was lulled. He shrugged his shoulders.
"Well, for what it is worth, I don't mind admitting that Grell did come
to see me. All he wanted was money. He is frightfully hard up, and
apparently the operations of your people have harassed him dreadfully."</p>

<p>"Did you let him have any money?"</p>

<p>Fairfield shook his head. "No; I absolutely refused unless he would come
out of concealment and try to justify himself. With that he went. He was
here less than twenty minutes or half an hour."</p>

<p>The detective played with his watch-chain. "Yes, yes. I don't see that
you could have done anything else. I suppose you made no suggestion to
him?"</p>

<p>"In what way?"</p>

<p>Gently stroking his chin, Foyle answered in a soft voice, "The other day
a man came to see me. He was a man of high social standing and had
fallen into the clutches of a gang of blackmailers. He wanted us to take
action, but he absolutely refused to go into the witness-box to give
evidence. I pressed him, pointing out that that was the only way in
which we could bring home anything against them. 'It will ruin me,' he
declared. 'Is there no other way it can be put a stop to?' I replied
that we were helpless. 'What can I do?' he cried. 'Is the thing they
accuse you of true?' I asked. He flushed and admitted that it was.
'Well,' I said, 'if you ask my advice as a man and not as an official, I
should meet with an accident.' But he would not take my advice," he
concluded, with a keen glance at the baronet, on whom the parable was
not lost.<!-- Page 259 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span></p>

<p>"I did suggest that way out," admitted the baronet reluctantly. "He
wouldn't hear of it. And Grell is not a coward."</p>

<p>"He gave no hint of where he was going when he left you?"</p>

<p>"Not the slightest."</p>

<p>Foyle picked up his hat. There was nothing more of value to be gained by
prolonging the interview. "I am very much obliged to you, Sir Ralph," he
said. "Perhaps you will keep in touch with me in case anything arises.
Good morning."</p>

<p>Long ago Foyle had made up his mind as to the probable course that would
be taken by Robert Grell. The man was evidently driven into a corner, or
he would scarcely have taken the enormous risk of going to see Ralph
Fairfield. There remained two things, the detective reasoned, which he
might now do. Penniless and without help, he might try to plunge back
into the obscurity of underground London, or he might try some other
friend or acquaintance. But every person he confided in would increase
his risk. Fairfield was his closest friend, and yet he had declined to
lift a finger. Would he go to men he was less intimate with&mdash;or would he
endeavour in person to enlist the aid of the woman he was to marry?</p>

<p>No one knew better than Heldon Foyle the danger of jumping to
conclusions. Inferences, however clever, however sound they may seem
when they are drawn, are apt to lead one astray. The detective who
habitually used the deductive method would spend a great deal of his
time exploring blind alleys. Yet Foyle, with the unostentatious Maxwell
at his right<!-- Page 260 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span> hand, hurried in the direction of Berkeley Square with a
hope that his theory might not be ill-founded.</p>

<p>A little distance away from the Duke of Burghley's house he crossed the
road and spoke to a cabman who was lounging on the seat of his
motionless vehicle. Curiously enough the constables patrolling the beat
did not order that particular cabman away to a rank, although he had
been there for several hours, creating a technical obstruction.</p>

<p>"Have you seen a man call over the road lately?" asked the
superintendent.</p>

<p>"No, sir," answered the cabman alertly. "The only person has been a
messenger-boy with a note for Lady Eileen Meredith. He told me it had
been handed in at the district messenger office at Victoria. Lady Eileen
came out shortly afterwards and walked away in the direction of
Piccadilly. Phillips has gone after her."</p>

<p>"Right. Report to the Yard directly she returns, and keep a sharp
look-out."</p>

<p>"Very good, sir," said the cab-driver, and Foyle turned away to mount
the steps of the house. The footman who answered the door replied that
both his Grace and the Lady Eileen were out. He could not say when they
would return. The superintendent tapped the step impatiently with the
tip of his well-polished American boot, and his brow puckered. Finally
he produced a card.</p>

<p>"I think I had better wait," he said. "My business is important." That
procured his admission into the house, but he had no idea of waiting in
idleness in one of the reception-rooms. Eileen had received a note<!-- Page 261 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
which had taken her out&mdash;he shrewdly suspected that it was from Grell.
It was conceivable, though it was not probable, that she might have left
it about. It was for him to learn the contents of that note if possible.
"Look here, old chap," he said, with an assumption of familiarity that
flattered the frigid footman, "I want to see Lady Eileen directly she
comes in, and I don't want to be announced." He winked as though from
one man of the world to another. "You understand, don't you?"</p>

<p>The footman grinned knowingly as he thrilled all over with the knowledge
that the Scotland Yard man was making a confidant of him. It was one of
Foyle's ways always to attach as many people as he could to his object.
He had an extensive acquaintance with waiters and hotel hall-porters.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, I think I can arrange that," said the footman. "I can put you
in her own sitting-room, and she'll most likely go straight there when
she comes back."</p>

<p>"That's the ticket," said Foyle. "I like a man who's got brains." A
sovereign changed hands. "Now, if you ever hear anything, perhaps you'll
let me know. Drop into my office when you're by and have a chat and a
cigar."</p>

<p>"I will that, sir," said the man. "Thank you, sir."</p>

<p>Heldon Foyle was left alone in the room. He sat quite still for a
little, but his eyes were busy. At last he rose and aimlessly paced the
floor once or twice. In the grate a dull fire was burning, and a few
fragments of blackened paper lay on the dying coals. Here and there a
word stood out in a mouldy grey against a<!-- Page 262 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span> black background. Foyle did
not touch the paper till he had read:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"... both ... minent ... sufficient money to ... ade for ... Petrov
... guesse ... fear ... timately exposure must come. If ... open
cheque ... ther ... gold, and bring ... God's sake ... desperate."</p></blockquote>

<p>Foyle's lips puckered into a whistle as he transferred the words to his
pocket-book. He dared not touch the fragments till he had done so, and
every moment he feared that some draught might destroy the whole thing.
His keen professional instincts were saddened by the impossibility of
saving what might be an important piece of evidence. Under favourable
circumstances there might have been some chance of retrieving and
preserving it by blocking the chimney to prevent a draught and then
carefully sticking the burnt fragments with gum on to transparent paper.
But that method was impossible. Foyle tried gingerly to rescue the
fragments, but a burst of flame frustrated him, and a moment later they
were destroyed.</p>

<p>An ejaculation of annoyance escaped his lips, and he turned to the
dainty little desk at another portion of the room. It was locked, but
that was a matter of little consequence. Like most detectives, Foyle
carried a bunch of keys rather larger than are to be found in the
possession of the ordinary man, and the fourth that he tried fitted.</p>

<p>The neat interior slab of the desk was clear and tidy. One or two
letters of no consequence reposed in<!-- Page 263 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span> an inside drawer, and these the
superintendent replaced. A footstep outside caused him hurriedly but
noiselessly to close the desk and resume his seat, sitting idly with
crossed legs. But the interrupter passed, and he returned to the desk.
From a recess he drew out a cheque-book and examined the counterfoils of
the used cheques with interest. The last counterfoil was blank.</p>

<p>"Ah!" he muttered, with a jerky little nod of satisfaction, and turned
his attention to the blotting-pad. A few minutes' close inspection and
he drew the top sheet away and, rolling it up, placed it in the
breast-pocket of his overcoat. Again he closed the desk and glanced at
his watch. A touch at the bell summoned the footman.</p>

<p>"I don't think I'll wait, after all," said Foyle. "Time's getting on,
and I've several things to attend to."</p>

<p>"Shall I tell Lady Eileen you called, sir?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes, certainly. Tell her I'll call back about six this evening."</p>

<p>In deep thought Heldon Foyle sauntered away from the house, and Maxwell
joined him as they turned a corner. The superintendent said nothing till
they reached Piccadilly. Then he tore a sheet of note-paper from his
pocket-book and handed it to his companion.</p>

<p>"Cut along up to the Metropolitan and Provincial Bank, Maxwell. A
cheque, No. A834,076 for &pound;200, signed Burghley, has been presented this
morning. Find out who cashed it and how it was paid. If there were any
notes, get their numbers and come straight on to me at the Yard."</p>

<p>The superintendent swung himself on to a passing<!-- Page 264 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span> motor-bus and selected
a seat on top, with his brain still revolving the events of the morning.
Once he took out a pencil and drafted a description of Grell's
appearance and dress as Roberts had seen him. As a matter of course, he
intended that to be telegraphed and telephoned to his men all over
London. It was as well not to neglect any precaution.</p>

<p>He was passing through the little back door which leads to the quarters
of the C.I.D. when he came face to face with a young man bearing all the
appearance of a clerk who was just passing out. "Hello, Phillips!" he
exclaimed. "You've been after Lady Eileen, haven't you? What luck did
you have?"</p>

<p>"I've just reported to Mr. Green, sir," was the answer. "She walked to
the Metropolitan and Provincial Bank and took a taxi when she came out.
I followed in another cab, but my man punctured a tyre in the Strand and
I missed her."</p>

<p>Foyle frowned and gripped the man's arm. "Come upstairs with me and tell
me all about it. What number was her taxi?"</p>

<p>"County Council LD&nbsp;6132, police 28,293. Mr. Green has got the name of
the driver from the Public Carriage Department, and I was just going out
to see if I could get hold of him."</p>

<p>"Right; you get along, then. And don't forget that if you miss people
like that again, accident or no accident, there'll be trouble."</p>

<p>Green was waiting for his chief. A question elicited the steps he had
taken to get hold of the driver of the cab, from whom some account of
Lady Eileen's movements might be expected. An all-station message had<!-- Page 265 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
been flashed out, asking that the cab, wherever it was sighted, should
be sent, unless still carrying a passenger, to Scotland Yard. There was
little chance of the driver neglecting to obey the summons.</p>

<p>"It's unlucky that our man failed to keep her in sight," said Foyle.
"I'll bet a hundred to one that she's arranged to meet Grell somewhere.
However, there's nothing to do now but to wait. Just look here, Green.
Here is something I picked out of the lady's fire. Help me and we'll see
if we can reconstruct the entire message."</p>

<p>He laid his pocket-book containing the string of disconnected words on
the desk as he spoke. The two bent over them.<!-- Page 266 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XLIII" id="CHAPTER_XLIII"></a>CHAPTER XLIII</h2>


<p>There is no person in London easier to find than a cab-driver whose
number is known, for the supervision of the Public Carriage Department
is exhaustive. Yet, even so, it was some hours before the man Foyle
sought was reported as being on his way to Scotland Yard.</p>

<p>He came at last, wonder and a little alarm in his face as he was brought
into the room where the superintendent and Green sat. There are many
rules the infringement of which will imperil a licence, and he was not
quite sure that he might not have broken one.</p>

<p>Foyle motioned for the door to be shut. "So you're the cab-driver we're
looking for, are you?" he said. "You're William White?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," answered the man. "That's my name."</p>

<p>"All right, White. There's nothing to be alarmed about. You picked up a
lady outside the Metropolitan and Provincial Bank this morning. Just sit
down and tell us where you took her."</p>

<p>"Oh, that is it?" said White, relieved to find that it was merely an
inquiry and not an offence that he was called upon to answer for. "Yes,
sir. I did pick up a lady there. I took her along to the General Post
Office, and waited while she went in. Then&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wait a minute," interrupted Foyle. "How long was she in there?"<!-- Page 267 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ten minutes as near as a touch, according to the way the taximeter
jumped while I was waiting. When she came out she asked me if I could
take her to Kingston. I said yes. And she told me to stop on the Surrey
side of Putney Bridge, because she expected to pick up a friend, sir.
Well, he was waiting there for us&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What kind of a looking man was he?"</p>

<p>"A tough sort of customer. Dressed like a labouring chap. I thought it
was a queer go, but it wasn't none of my business, and ladies take queer
fancies at times. She didn't say nothing to him that I could hear, but
just leaned out of the window and beckoned. He jumped in and off we
went. We stopped at a tailor's shop in Kingston, and the man went in
while the lady stayed in the cab."</p>

<p>"What was the name of the shop?"</p>

<p>"I didn't notice. I could show it to any one, though, if I went there
again."</p>

<p>"Very well. Go on," said Foyle curtly.</p>

<p>"Well, in a matter of a couple of minutes out comes the chap again and
spoke to the lady. She got out and paid me off. He went back into the
shop and she walked away down the street."</p>

<p>"And that's the last you saw of them, I suppose?" asked the
superintendent, with his left hand rubbing vigorously at his chin.</p>

<p>White shook his head. "No, sir. I went away and had a bit of grub before
coming back. As I passed Kingston railway station, I saw the lady
standing by a big motor-car, talking to the man seated at the wheel. I
thought at first it was the chap I had driven down, but<!-- Page 268 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span> I could see it
wasn't when I got a closer look at him. He was better dressed and held
himself straighter."</p>

<p>"Ah! Could you describe him? Did you notice the number of the car?"</p>

<p>The driver scratched his head. "A sort of ordinary-looking man, sir. I
didn't take much stock of him. The car was A&nbsp;1245&mdash;a big brown thing
with an open body."</p>

<p>"Right you are, White," said Foyle with a nod of dismissal. "That will
do for now. You go down and wait in the yard with your cab, and we'll
get some one to go with you to Kingston. And keep your mouth shut about
what you've told us."</p>

<p>When the door closed behind the man, his eyes met those of the chief
detective-inspector. "You'll have to go to Kingston, Green. It's a hot
scent there. You've got the numbers of the notes that Maxwell got from
the bank. Find out if any of them were changed at the tailor's. They've
taken precautions to blind the trail. What I think happened is, that she
telephoned from the General Post Office to some motor-car firm to send a
car from London to Kingston railway station, under the impression that
it would be less risky. He went into the tailor's place to arrange for a
change of clothes, and she dismissed the taxi as a measure of
precaution. It was a piece of luck that the man noticed the motor-car,
but we can't be absolutely certain of the number he gave. He had no
particular reason to remember it. Anyway, I'll send it out to the county
police, and ask them to keep their eyes open. Meanwhile, I'll set some
men to work to see if any of the big garages have sent a car to
Kingston, and<!-- Page 269 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span> get the number verified. If you 'phone me when you get
down there, I'll let you know how things stand."</p>

<p>Green had his hand on the handle of the door, but suddenly something
occurred to him. "Do you think she's gone with him, sir?"</p>

<p>Heldon Foyle made a little gesture of dissent. "I don't think it likely.
It would double the danger of identification. But we can soon find if
she's gone back to her home. I told Taylor, who is watching in Berkeley
Square, to report when she returned." He touched a bell and put a
question to the man who entered.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," was the reply. "He rang up half an hour ago. You told me I
wasn't to disturb you. He reported Lady Eileen Meredith had just gone
in."</p>

<p>"There you are, then, Green," said Foyle. "That point's settled. You get
along. I wish I could come with you, but it won't do for me to leave
London just now, and goodness knows where you may have to finish up.
Good-bye and good luck."</p>

<p>When Green had gone, Foyle gave a few instructions to cover the points
that had arisen, and walked to Sir Hilary Thornton's room. The Assistant
Commissioner looked up and proffered a cigar. "Think of the angels," he
said. "I was just wondering how things were going."</p>

<p>"Things are straightening out a bit," said the superintendent. "It's
been a busy day, and it's not over yet." And, puffing a ring of smoke
into the air, he told in bare, unadorned fashion the events of the day.
"It has been a narrow thing for Grell," he concluded. "Even now, I fancy
we shall get him. Green's as<!-- Page 270 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span> tenacious as a bull-dog when he's got
something to take hold of."</p>

<p>With his hands thrust deep in his trousers pockets, Sir Hilary strode to
and fro across the room. "It's time we got a bit forward," he said. "The
adjourned inquest will come on again soon, and we shan't be able to keep
the question of identity up our sleeves any longer."</p>

<p>"There's a week yet," answered Foyle. "I don't think it will much matter
what is revealed then."</p>

<p>The Assistant Commissioner came to a halt. "You're not a man to be
over-confident, Foyle," he explained. "Do you feel pretty certain of
having Grell under arrest by that time? I've not interfered with you
hitherto, but for heaven's sake be careful. It won't do to make a
mistake&mdash;especially with a man of Grell's standing."</p>

<p>Heldon Foyle lifted his shoulders deprecatingly. "It all depends upon an
idea I have, sir. I am willing to take all responsibility."</p>

<p>"You're still convinced that Grell is guilty?"</p>

<p>"I am convinced that he knows all about the murder," answered Foyle
ambiguously. "With the help of Pinkerton's, I've traced his history back
for the last twenty-five years. He's had his hands in some queer
episodes in his time before he became a millionaire. There are gaps
which we can't fill up, of course, but we're pretty complete. There was
one thing in his favour. Although he's known toughs in all corners of
the world, he's never been mixed up in any dirty business. And as he's
carried out one or two political missions for the United States, I
suppose he's had to<!-- Page 271 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span> know some of these people. To-morrow or the next
day, I expect to have the records of both Ivan Abramovitch and Condit.
It will all help, though the bearing on the murder is perhaps indirect."</p>

<p>"You're talking in parables, like a detective out of a book," said
Thornton, with a peevishness that his covering smile could not entirely
conceal. "But I know you'll have your own way when you don't want to be
too precise. How do you regard the burnt paper? Is it important?"</p>

<p>"It would have been if I could have saved it," said the detective
regretfully. "As it is, it's of no use as evidence in a court, for it
only rests on my word. I keep pegging away at it, but I'm not certain
that I can fill it out as it should be. But you never know your luck in
our trade. I remember a case of forgery once. The counterfoil of a
tradesman's paying-in book showed &pound;100 with which he was not credited in
the books of the bank. The cashier was confident that his initials in
blue pencil on the counterfoil were genuine. Yet he was equally certain
that he had not received the money. The tradesman was certain that he
had sent the money. There it was. I was at a dead end. One day, I
noticed a little stationer's store near the tradesman's office. In the
window were some blue pencils. I walked in and bought something, and
casually remarked that I shouldn't have thought there was much demand
for those pencils. 'Oh, schoolboys buy 'em,' said the old woman who
served me. 'There's old &mdash;&mdash;s' son over the way. He buys half a dozen at
a time.' Well, off I went to the grammar school that the boy was
attending, and had a talk with one<!-- Page 272 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span> of the masters. He admitted that the
lad was exceptionally clever at drawing. I was beginning to see my way,
so had the boy called out of his class into a private room. 'Now, tell
me, my boy,' I said, 'what did you do with the money you stole from your
father on such and such a date?' The bluff worked. He turned pale, and
then admitted that he had forged the initials, taken the money, and gone
on a joy-jaunt for a week while he was supposed to be staying with an
aunt. There was the luck of the idea coming in my head through looking
at those pencils."</p>

<p>"Have you been looking at blue pencils to-day?" asked Thornton with
interest.</p>

<p>"Something of the kind," admitted Foyle with a smile, and before he
could be questioned further had vanished.</p>

<p>He had said nothing of the blotting-paper incident, for there were times
when he wished to keep his own counsel even within the precincts of
Scotland Yard itself. He did not wish to pin himself down until he was
sure. In his own room, he unlocked the big safe that stood between the
two windows, and taking out the roll he had abstracted from Lady
Eileen's desk, surveyed it with a whimsical smile playing about the
corners of his mouth. Once he held it to the mirror, and the word
"Burghley" was plainly reflected.</p>

<p>"That ought to do," he murmured to himself, and, replacing it in the
safe, swung the heavy door to.</p>

<p>The jig-saw puzzle to which he had likened criminal investigations was
not so jumbled as it had been. One or two bits of the picture were
beginning to stick together, though there were others that did not seem
to<!-- Page 273 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span> have any points of junction. Foyle pulled out the dossier of the
case, and again went over the evidence that had been collected. He knew
it practically by heart, but one could never be too certain that nothing
had been overlooked. He was so engaged when Mr. Fred Trevelyan was
announced.</p>

<p>"Fred Trevelyan? Who is he?" he asked mechanically, his brain still
striving with the problem he wished to elucidate.</p>

<p>"That's the name he gave, sir," answered the clerk, who ranked as a
detective-sergeant. "I should call him Dutch Fred."</p>

<p>"Oh, I was wandering. Send him in."</p>

<p>There was nothing of the popular conception of the criminal about Freddy
as he swaggered into the room, bearing a glossy silk hat of the latest
fashionable shape on one arm. His morning coat was of faultless cut. His
trousers were creased with precision. Grey spats covered his well-shone
boots.</p>

<p>Foyle shook hands with him, and his blue eyes twinkled humorously. "On
the war-path, I see, Freddy. Sit down. What's the game? Going to the big
fight?"</p>

<p>The last remark was made with an object. Professional boxing attracts
perhaps a larger number of the criminal fraternity than any other sport,
except, possibly, horse-racing. In many cases, it is purely and simply
love of the game that attracts. There is no ulterior motive. But in the
case of Freddy, and men in his line, there was always the chance of
combining pleasure with profit. The hint was not lost on the
pick-pocket. A hurt expression crossed his face.<!-- Page 274 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, Mr. Foyle," he declared earnestly. "I don't take any interest in
boxing. I just called in to put you wise to something as I was passing."</p>

<p>"That's very nice of you, Freddy. What was it?"</p>

<p>The pick-pocket dropped his voice. "It's about Harry Goldenburg," he
said. "I saw him to-day."</p>

<p>Foyle beat a tattoo on his desk with his fingers. "That so?" he said
listlessly. "Out on the Portsmouth Road, I suppose?"</p>

<p>Dutch Fred sat up with a start. "Yes," he agreed, "just outside
Kingston. How did you know?"</p>

<p>"Just a guess," laughed the superintendent. "Well, what about it? Did
you speak to him?"</p>

<p>"I didn't have a chance," retorted Freddy. "I was in a little run-about
with a pal when he came scooting by hell-for-leather. We only got a
glimpse of him, and if he noticed us he made no sign. I thought you'd
like to know, that's all. It was an open car, brown colour. I couldn't
see the number for dust; it was A something."</p>

<p>"Well, we know all that," said Foyle. "All the same, Freddy, I am glad
you dropped in: I won't forget it."</p>

<p>"Right oh, Mr. Foyle. Good evening." And the pick-pocket swaggered out,
while Foyle thoughtfully stowed away his papers.</p>

<p>Some one brought in a cup of tea and some biscuits, and his watch showed
him that it was a quarter to five. He had promised to call on Lady
Eileen about six o'clock, and his mind dwelt on the potentialities of
the interview as he lingered over his frugal meal. He had<!-- Page 275 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span> just poured
out his second cup, when the telephone buzzer behind him jarred.</p>

<p>"A call from Liverpool, sir," said the man in the private exchange. "Mr.
Blake wants you. Shall I put him through?"</p>

<p>A few minutes elapsed before Foyle heard the voice of the man who had
been outwitted by the Princess Petrovska. "Is that Mr. Foyle? This is
Blake speaking. We've got on the track of the lady again. She'd been
staying at a boarding-house pretending she was a member of a theatrical
company. A local man spotted her and came back to fetch me to make
certain of her identity. But she must have got wind of it somehow, for
she's hired a motor and slipped off. We're after her now. She's only got
half an hour's start, and we've wired to have the main roads watched. I
expect we'll have her in an hour or two."</p>

<p>The superintendent coughed. "Get along then, Blake. And don't smoke when
you're on the job this time. Good-bye."</p>

<p>He replaced the receiver and returned to his neglected cup of tea.
Things were evidently stirring. Was it altogether chance, he wondered,
that Petrovska had chosen the day to make a move? Strange coincidences
did happen at times, yet there was a possibility that her movements were
correlated to those of Grell. Had the two managed to communicate? Well,
at any rate he could rely on Blake and his assistants to find out
whether she had received letters or messages. The matter was out of his
hands, and it was not his habit to worry about affairs which he could
not influence.<!-- Page 276 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XLIV" id="CHAPTER_XLIV"></a>CHAPTER XLIV</h2>


<p>That Heldon Foyle had come so closely on the heels of Grell's message
was something of a shock to Eileen. She had not supposed that the
detectives would be so quickly again on the trail. Her heart beat a
little quicker, but her face gave no sign as she drew off her gloves
while the footman told her of the superintendent's call at six.</p>

<p>When she was alone she sat with her long, slender hands gripping the
arms of her chair, her grey eyes reflecting the light of the fire as she
stared abstractedly into its depths. That she had done her utmost to
help Grell escape she did not regret; she rather triumphed in the fact.
Foyle could know nothing of that&mdash;at the worst he could only suspect.
Her precautions had been too complete. She was confident that she and
Grell were the only two people who knew of the day's happenings. In any
case, she argued to herself, it was better to see Foyle. She had come to
respect his acumen, and fear he might draw an inference not too far from
the truth if she denied him an interview. Besides, she asked herself,
what had she to fear? Grell was safely away, and she could trust not to
betray herself.</p>

<p>At six o'clock to the minute a footman&mdash;whose wooden face gave no
indication of the fact that a moment before he had confidently informed
Foyle in a stage whisper, "She seemed pretty cheerful when she came in,
sir&mdash;been sitting all alone since"<!-- Page 277 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>&mdash;brought her a card. Then Foyle was
ushered in&mdash;calm and unruffled as though he were merely making a social
call. She returned his bow frigidly.</p>

<p>"I hope you will not consider my call inconvenient, Lady Eileen," he
said suavely. "I considered it of importance that I should see you as
soon as possible."</p>

<p>She crossed her knees and regarded him composedly. "I am sorry I was out
when you called this morning. Had I known, I should have waited for
you."</p>

<p>The detective admired the manner in which the girl carried off a
difficult situation. She spoke quite indifferently, and yet he knew that
she was entirely on her guard. He smoothed the top of his hat with his
hand.</p>

<p>"Sometimes an appointment with one's bankers is a thing one can't put
off," he said blandly.</p>

<p>A tiny spot of colour burned in each of her cheeks and she flashed one
quick look at the detective. This was an attack in flank which she had
not expected. "My bankers?" she lied instantly, "I have not been to my
bankers'."</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon," he said, his voice keyed to a curious inflection.
"I was under the impression that you had&mdash;that, in fact, you changed a
cheque for &pound;200 made payable to bearer."</p>

<p>She tried to hide a new feeling of alarm under a smile. "Well, and if I
did?" she challenged. "That is, of course, my private business, Mr.
Foyle. You surely haven't come to cross-examine me on my habits of
personal extravagance?"</p>

<p>"Partly," he countered. "Shall we be plain with one another?"<!-- Page 278 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span></p>

<p>She rose and stood with one arm resting on the mantelpiece, looking down
on him. "By all means let us be plain. I am only a girl and I cannot
altogether follow the subtleties of your work."</p>

<p>"We are not such dreadful people really," he smiled. "We try to do
unpleasant work as little unpleasantly as possible. As you say, you are
only a girl, and although perhaps uncommonly clever, you are&mdash;if you
will pardon me&mdash;a little apt to let your impulses outreach your reason.
More than once I have tried to advise you as I would my own daughter.
Well, now, here is some more advice&mdash;for what it is worth. Tell me
exactly what you did between the time you went out this morning and the
time you came in&mdash;whom you saw and where you went. Will you do that?"</p>

<p>The tick of a small clock on the mantelpiece was loud. Eileen
contemplated the tips of her boots with interest. Then a little ripple
of laughter shook her. "You are a dreadfully suspicious man. If it
interests you, then, you can have it. I went to the bank, and from there
took a cab to my dressmaker's, where I paid a bill and was fitted for a
new gown. I went on and did some shopping at various places. Shall I
write out an exact account for you?"</p>

<p>If it had been the detective's design to entrap her into a series of
falsehoods he might easily have done so. But there was no object in
pursuing that course. He met her ingenuous gaze with a little lift of
his shoulders. "This is mere foolishness, Lady Eileen. I want to give
you the opportunity of stating frankly what occurred from the moment you
got Robert Grell's letter this morning. You know this story of the
dressmaker would<!-- Page 279 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span> fall to pieces the instant we started making inquiries
to verify it."</p>

<p>"So I'm on my defence, then?" she said abruptly. He nodded and watched
closely the changing expression of her features. "I have done nothing
that gives you any right to question me," she went on defiantly. "And I
am not going to submit to any more questions. Good morning. Can you find
your own way out?"</p>

<p>She caught at her skirt with one hand and with her chin tilted high in
the air would have withdrawn haughtily from the room. She was afraid
that his shrewd, persistent questioning and persuasion might end in
eliciting from her more unguarded admissions. He had reached the door
before her, however, and stood leaning with his back against it and his
legs crossed and his arms folded. She stopped sharply and he divined her
intention.</p>

<p>"I shouldn't touch the bell if I were you," he said peremptorily. "It
will be better for both of us if I say what I have got to say alone."</p>

<p>The decision in his tone stopped her as her hand was half-way to the
bell-push. She paused irresolute, and at last her hand dropped at her
side. Foyle moved to her, laid a gentle hand on her shoulder and half
forced her to a seat. After all, with all her beauty and her wits she
was but a wayward child. Her eyes questioned him and her lips quivered a
little.</p>

<p>"Now," he said sternly. "Tell me if your father signed the cheque you
cashed, or whether you put his signature to it yourself?"</p>

<p>Her lips moved dumbly and the room seemed to quiver around her. Finely
as she had held herself in control hitherto, she was now thoroughly
unnerved. She<!-- Page 280 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span> covered her face with her hands, and her frail figure
shook with dry sobs. Foyle waited patiently for the outburst to pass.
Suddenly she sprang to her feet and faced him with clenched hands.</p>

<p>"Yes, I did sign it," she blazed. "My father was out, and I wanted the
money at once. He will not mind&mdash;he would have given it to me had he
been here."</p>

<p>He checked her with a deprecating movement of his hand. "Don't excite
yourself, please," he said soothingly. "I felt bound to let you see
there was a serious reason why I should press you to give an account of
your movements to-day. Sit down quietly for a moment."</p>

<p>He waited patiently while she resumed her seat. He had foreseen that
while she was on her guard he was unlikely either by threats or coaxing
to induce her to speak. The hint of forgery had been deliberately
intended to throw her off her balance. She could not know that her
blotting-pad had betrayed that and more. Nor could she know that without
the evidence of her father and the bank officials&mdash;neither of which was
likely to be willingly given in the circumstances&mdash;she was not amenable
to a criminal charge. "Will you tell me now why you were so anxious to
obtain that money&mdash;why you could not wait for an hour or two until your
father returned? Don't hurry yourself. Think. Remember that I shall be
able to check what you say."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;" She choked and gulped as if swallowing something.</p>

<p>"Will it help you if I tell you that two of the notes which were given
in exchange for the cheque were changed at a tailor's shop at Kingston,
where a rough-looking man bought an overcoat and a suit of clothes?"<!-- Page 281 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span></p>

<p>"You&mdash;know&mdash;that?" she gasped, the words coming slowly one by one from
her lips. The accuracy of his knowledge, and the swiftness with which it
must have been gained both astonished and astounded her.</p>

<p>"I know that," he repeated. "And I know more. I know, for instance, that
Mr. Grell went to Sir Ralph Fairfield before applying to you. Did he
tell you that?" He waited, but she made no answer. "I know too that he
has left London. You know where he is making for. Where is it?"</p>

<p>Slowly she shook her head. "I can't tell you," she cried vehemently.
"You cannot force me to. He is an innocent man. You know he is. You can
expose me&mdash;tell all the world that I have been guilty of forgery if you
like&mdash;you will not get me to lift a finger to hound him to his death."</p>

<p>Foyle had failed. He knew it was of little use pushing the matter
further. He picked up his hat and gloves and mechanically passed a hand
over his forehead. But there was one thing that had to be done before he
left. "I will not trouble you any further now," he said in a level
voice. "I may take it you will tell your father of the&mdash;the banking
episode. That will relieve me of a rather painful task."</p>

<p>"I will tell him," she said dully.</p>

<p>"Then good evening, Lady Eileen."</p>

<p>"Good evening."</p>

<p>The superintendent drew on his gloves as he passed out of the street
door. "She knows her own mind, that girl," he said to himself. "She
won't give away a thing. Either she's very much in love with him,
or&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He rounded the corner into Berkeley Street.<!-- Page 282 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XLV" id="CHAPTER_XLV"></a>CHAPTER XLV</h2>


<p>The first part of the commission given by Heldon Foyle to Chief
Detective-Inspector Green was simple to execute and cost him no effort
of ingenuity. A straight drive through into Kingston, a call at the
tailor's shop where Grell had re-fitted himself with clothes, and a few
minutes' conversation with the assistant who had served him, gave him
all the facts concerning the appearance of the man he was following.</p>

<p>"I'd better take these two notes away," he said, beginning to fold up
the flimsies. "I shall want you to keep a note of the numbers, in case
you are called upon to give evidence."</p>

<p>The tailor scratched his head doubtfully, and cast a glance on a
policeman passing slowly on the other side of the street. He was
beginning to suspect the tall stranger who asserted he was a police
officer, and so calmly appropriated money. He was wondering whether,
after all, it might not be an ingenious scheme of robbery. He had heard
of such things, and the composure of the detective did not comfort him.
Green had given no proof of his identity beyond his bare word.</p>

<p>With some mumbled excuse the tailor stepped to the door and beckoned to
the policeman. With much volubility he explained the situation and his
suspicions. The constable listened gravely. He was very young to his
duties, and remembered the cautions that had been given him not to
accept any one's word where actions were suspicious.<!-- Page 283 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span></p>

<p>"He didn't show you a warrant-card, did he?" he asked. "All right, Mr.
Jones, you leave this to me." And he marched importantly into the shop.</p>

<p>Green, who had just lit a well-worn brier pipe, and was waiting for the
assistant to return in order to pay him the value of the notes, smiled
grimly at the apparition of the constable in uniform. He guessed exactly
what had happened.</p>

<p>"This is the man?" asked the police officer. The tailor nodded, and he
went on, addressing Green, "What's this about you taking money and
pretending to be a police officer?" He had produced an official notebook
and looked very important as he loomed in the doorway, gazing sternly at
the detective. "Don't answer any questions unless you want to. You know
I shall have to take anything you say down in writing, and it may be
used as evidence against you."</p>

<p>The situation had a piquant humour that tickled Green. The constable was
strictly within his duty, as he had been called in, but the pomposity of
his manner betokened that he was very, very young in the service. In a
deliberate silence the detective felt in his pocket for a warrant-card
that would clear up the mistake. A moment later he was wildly searching
in all his pockets without success. For the first time in a lifetime in
the service he must have been careless enough to leave it at home.</p>

<p>He flourished a number of envelopes inscribed "Chief Detective-Inspector
Green, New Scotland Yard, S.W.," but the knowing look of the young
constable was emphasised by the cock of the eyebrows. Green never
carried official documents except when he was obliged to.<!-- Page 284 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span></p>

<p>"That won't do, old chap," said the constable, in the manner of one well
used to the ways of the criminal fraternity. "You don't come that on me.
You might have written those envelopes yourself. You'll have to come
along."</p>

<p>If the letters had failed to impress him, Green felt certain that his
visiting-card would be of little use. Since he had decided to visit the
police station in any case, it did not much matter. It was humiliating,
in a way, but it did not much matter.</p>

<p>"All right, my man," he said authoritatively. "I'll see the station
officer. Send for a cab."</p>

<p>"Cool hand, isn't it?" whispered the policeman to the tailor. "See how
he's dropped trying to pull off his bluff on me. Just hop out and see if
you can find a cab. I'll keep an eye on him."</p>

<p>So it was that a high official of the Criminal Investigation Department
reached an outlying police station under the conduct of a young
constable whose swelling pride was soon reduced to abject misery as the
divisional detective-inspector, who was leaning on a high desk and
chatting with a station-sergeant, sprang forward to greet the suspect.</p>

<p>"They 'phoned through from headquarters for me to meet you here, sir.
There's one or two messages come through for you."</p>

<p>The constable's jaw dropped. "Is this man&mdash;this gentleman from the
Yard?" he gasped.</p>

<p>The local man stared from Green to the policeman, and from the policeman
to Green. Some notion of what had happened began to occur to him. "What
the<!-- Page 285 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span> blazes&mdash;&mdash;" he began, but the chief inspector cut him short.</p>

<p>"That's all right," he said. "I was careless enough to come out without
a warrant-card, and this young man has made a little mistake. Don't you
worry about it, my lad. Only, next time, don't put so much zeal into a
doubtful case. Cut along back to your beat and give that chap this."
Some sovereigns chinked. "Now, Mr. Malley, I'll be glad to have those
messages, and to put a call through to Mr. Foyle."</p>

<p>He followed Malley into an inner room, and the local man handed him a
couple of messages which had been telephoned to Scotland Yard by the
county police, and one sent by Foyle immediately after his interview
with Dutch Fred, giving amplified particulars of the car. Green made his
report over the telephone and then, replacing the receiver, turned to
Malley. "This last message shows he's got a good start. He passed
through Haslemere an hour ago. Can you get away yourself, or have you
got a good man you can lend me?"</p>

<p>"That's all arranged, sir," was the answer. "Mr. Foyle said that I was
to go with you if you wanted me."</p>

<p>"Right. We'll have to rake out a good car somewhere. You see to that.
We'll pick up any fresh news at the county police station at Haslemere.
This man may have been stopped by now."</p>

<p>Malley was already speaking into the telephone. He paused for a moment.
"Will a chauffeur be necessary, sir? I could drive if you liked."</p>

<p>"So much the better. Tell 'em to hustle the car<!-- Page 286 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span> along here. It'll be
just as well to have plenty of petrol."</p>

<p>A matter of ten minutes or a quarter of an hour before the motor-car was
at the police station. Malley slipped into the driver's seat, and Green
coiled up his long body by his side. With a jerk they started, and in a
little were out on the broad Portsmouth road, while a thin, penetrating
rain was powdering the windscreen. Presently Malley increased the speed
and, though it was well outside the legal limit, Green made no
remonstrance.</p>

<p>Stolid and unimaginative as he might seem to casual acquaintance, the
chief inspector usually worked with tremendous enthusiasm and
doggedness. As Foyle had said, he was as tenacious as a bull-dog. He was
determined to catch Grell, if human wit and perseverance could do it.
And he chafed to think that the start had been so long.</p>

<p>Dusk had fallen before they entered Haslemere, pausing only to ask their
way to the local police headquarters. Short as the run had been, they
were both chilled to the bone, and their overcoats were sodden with
rain. There was no thought of a halt, however. A man ran bare-headed out
of the police station door as though he had been waiting for them.</p>

<p>"Mr. Green?" he asked.</p>

<p>"That's my name," answered the chief inspector.</p>

<p>"Your people have been on the 'phone to us, and so have the Hampshire
Constabulary at Petersfield. Nothing has been seen of the car you want
since it passed through here, apparently on the way to Petersfield. We
didn't know you wanted it held up till too<!-- Page 287 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span> late, but one of our bicycle
patrols remembered having seen it go by. Ten minutes later, we got word.
Both Petersfield and Midhurst have had men out waiting for it. No luck
at all. It seems to have vanished clean off the face of the earth.
You'll probably meet some of our bicycle patrols if you're going on.
We've been searching the by-roads."</p>

<p>Green bit back an expletive. The prospect of a night's search in the wet
and wind and rain did not appeal to him. There seemed no help for it,
however. "Much obliged," he said. "We'll watch for your men. Drive on,
Mr. Malley." And they slipped forward into the gloom.</p>

<p>"There's too much of the needle in a haystack business about this to
suit my taste," he complained when once they were clear of the town.
"That car might have taken any one of fifty side-turnings. Anyway, we'll
go on to Petersfield and see whether they've had any luck. Slow down a
bit. There's not much object in speed now."</p>

<p>Presently their big acetylene lights picked out a caped policeman
standing in the centre of the roadway, his arm upraised for them to
halt. They could see his bicycle resting on the grass. As they stopped,
he advanced and, glancing at the number on the bonnet, scrutinised the
two detectives sharply.</p>

<p>"It's all right, constable," said Malley. "We're not the people you're
looking for. We're from London, and we're looking for the same man."</p>

<p>The policeman, satisfied, stepped back with a clumsy salute and a "Beg
pardon, gentlemen," and once more<!-- Page 288 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span> they were off. Ten minutes later,
another cyclist, pedaling furiously, rode into the zone of light cast by
their head-lamps. A hail brought him to a stop, and Green put a
question, explaining who he was.</p>

<p>"We've found it, sir," exclaimed the man excitedly. "It's in a lane at
the other side of the little village called Dalehurst, a mile farther
up. It had been run into a ditch and left there. There's no sign of the
man who was in it. I'm just riding in to report. There's a sergeant
looking after it."</p>

<p>"Never mind about reporting, yet," said Green. "You come back with us
and show us where this car is. I'll take all responsibility."</p>

<p>They travelled on at a pace that permitted the cyclist to keep
alongside, and presently, turning sharply to the right, picked their way
along a narrow roadway which, overgrown with grass and flanked by
densely-wooded country, was as desolate and lonely a spot as could be
conceived. The car bumped and swayed over ruts and hummocks, and Green
touched his companion's sleeve to bid him stop.</p>

<p>"We shall get on quicker and safer if we walk," he said, and dropped
stiffly to the ground. Malley followed suit, and swung his arms
vigorously about his body to restore some degree of warmth to his
cramped frame.</p>

<p>"We'll carry one of the headlights with us," said Green. "Faith, it's
muddy."</p>

<p>Their boots made a soft, squelching noise as they tramped on under black
shadows of the trees for a hundred yards. The track of the previous car
was embedded plain on the soft earth. And here and there<!-- Page 289 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span> were footmarks
recently made which the three avoided confusing, on Green's order, by
keeping to the side of the roadway. The wheelmarks ended abruptly round
a slight bend, where they came upon the car itself. It was tilted at an
acute angle, with its leading front wheel embedded in the low ditch. All
the lights had been extinguished, and the rear of the car, with the
number, was picked out in high relief against the dark background by the
acetylene light carried by Malley.</p>

<p>"Who's that?" growled a husky voice, and a police-sergeant stepped into
the section of light.</p>

<p>"It's all right, sergeant," said the man who had acted as guide to the
detectives. "It's only two gentlemen from London who are engaged on the
case. I met them and brought them along."</p>

<p>The chief inspector had taken the lamp from Malley and was throwing its
light on the ground around the car. Then he stepped into the car itself
and began a minute inspection of rugs and cushions. The search was only
a matter of habit, and it revealed nothing. He stepped down and pointed
to some footprints. "Any one been here but you two men?" he asked.
"Here, both of you, press your right feet here. That's it." He
contemplated the marks with careful deliberation for a while, and then,
stepping wide, followed a series of footmarks leading up the lane.</p>

<p>"Our gentleman walked pretty fast," observed Green. "See how plain the
heel and toe marks come out, while the rest of the impression is
blurred. Hello! what's this?"</p>

<p>The road had terminated abruptly in a bridle-path leading apparently to
the interior of the wood, and the<!-- Page 290 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span> foot-prints had become more and more
indistinct with the transition to ground covered with fallen leaves.
They had failed entirely as Green spoke, and he flung the light about in
an effort to pick them up again. Then something met his eye on a spike
of blackthorn, and he carefully picked off a thread of brown cloth.
"We're done for to-night, I'm afraid," he said. "He's gone off the track
and got into the wood. We'll get back, Malley, and try to find a room or
somewhere to sleep near here. Then we can turn out with daylight. But
first of all we must 'phone to the Yard. By the way, sergeant, do you
know whose estate we're on?"</p>

<p>"I'm not quite sure," growled the officer. "It used to be Colonel
Sawford's, but I believe he sold it to that man who was killed in London
a little while back. Grell was his name, wasn't it?"</p>

<p>"Really? Thank you, sergeant. Come on, Malley. Perhaps we can find the
village post office and use the 'phone."<!-- Page 291 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XLVI" id="CHAPTER_XLVI"></a>CHAPTER XLVI</h2>


<p>It was to Heldon Foyle's own house, and not to Scotland Yard, that Green
telephoned eventually. Clad in a bright blue dressing-gown, the
superintendent listened, with a few non-committal interjections, until
his lieutenant had finished.</p>

<p>"On his own land, eh?" he said at last. "What do you make of it, Green?
Is it genuine, or has he done it just to throw us off, and doubled back
on his trail? It looks as if he intended us to find that motor-car."</p>

<p>Green disagreed. "It's a deserted, blind road made for wood-cutters
years ago. It was only a chance that a constabulary sergeant found it.
He may have left it there for the time being, relying on coming back to
hide it properly out of sight. And this is an ideal place for any one to
keep close. It would take a thousand men to search the wood anything
like thoroughly."</p>

<p>"There's some sort of house on the estate, I suppose?" demanded Foyle.</p>

<p>"Yes, I've not been up to it, but I'm told it's a big, rambling old
place called Dalehurst Grange, approached through sloping meadows and
backing on to the woods. It would be easy for a man to see any one in
the house coming from the front and slip away into the undergrowth.
Malley's gone up to have a look at<!-- Page 292 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span> the place. We'll need a search
warrant to go over the place, but I don't think it'll be any good."</p>

<p>"Nor I," agreed Foyle. "It'll have to be done some other way. You've
asked the county constabulary to make inquiries and to watch the railway
stations round about, of course? All right. You run things on your own
discretion, and if you or Malley see me just shut your eyes. Now give me
your address and report to the Yard as usual."</p>

<p>The superintendent lit a cigar after he had replaced the receiver, and
thoughtfully toasted his slippered feet before the fire. Presently he
rose, turned over the leaves of a time-table, and discovering that
Dalehurst possessed no railway station, discarded it in favour of a
gazetteer. From that he found that the village was four miles from
Deepnook, and the time-table again consulted showed him that he could
reach the latter place in a couple of hours from Waterloo.</p>

<p>Before he went to bed that night he packed the kit-bag that had
accompanied him in most of his wanderings all over the globe. Other
things than clothes found a place in its depths, among them a jemmy,
some putty, and a glazier's diamond. The superintendent had an idea that
they might be more effective than a search warrant.</p>

<p>Yet, as he turned the key, he realised that the energy and the efforts
of both himself and Green might be wasted. There was a possibility that
it was a blind trail&mdash;that Grell had contrived the whole thing as a
blind, and had slipped out of the net that had been drawn for the brown
motor-car. The thought induced Foyle to telephone through to
headquarters to order a fresh<!-- Page 293 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span> warning to be wired through to the police
at all the ports. He believed in leaving as little as possible to
chance.</p>

<p>The night staff was still on duty when he reached Scotland Yard the next
morning. The detective-inspector in charge stared at a corpulent man
clad in a Norfolk jacket, knickerbockers of brown tweed, whose heavy
boots clanged along the corridor. The hair, moustache, and eyebrows of
the intruder were a shiny black, and a little trimming with scissors and
a judicious use of a comb and brush had altered the appearance of the
superintendent's face as completely as the clothes had altered his
figure.</p>

<p>He was no believer in stage disguises. False beards and wigs were liable
to go wrong at critical moments. He nodded reassuringly to the inspector
and placed his kit-bag on the floor.</p>

<p>"It's all right, I'm Foyle right enough. I'm thinking of a change of air
for a day or two," was all the explanation he vouchsafed. "I want to
just run through my letters and catch the nine-ten train from Waterloo.
I'll leave a note over for Mr. Mainland, who'll take charge while I'm
away."</p>

<p>He went methodically through the heavy morning's correspondence,
pencilling a few notes here and there on the letters, and sorting them
into baskets ranged on the table as he finished. Precisely at a quarter
to nine he touched a bell, and gave a few brief instructions. Then,
carrying his bag, he descended the flight of steps at the front entrance
and walked briskly along the Embankment. As he crossed the footway of
Hungerford Bridge, a biting wind swept up the river and he<!-- Page 294 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span> shivered,
warmly clad though he was. One of his own men passed without recognising
him, and the superintendent smiled to himself.</p>

<p>There were five minutes to spare when he sank into the corner seat of a
smoking compartment, and composed himself with a couple of morning
papers for the journey. But he read very little. There was much to
occupy his mind, and as the train slipped out of Waterloo station he
tossed the periodicals aside, crossed his knees, blew a cloud of smoke
into the air, and with a little gold pencil made a few notes on a
visiting-card. London slipped away, and an aeroplane flying low came
into his line of vision as they passed Weybridge. The open pasture
meadows gave place to more wooded country, and he placed his pencil back
in his pocket as they ran into Deepnook.</p>

<p>A solitary porter shuffled forward to take his bag. Foyle handed it
over. "Is there a good hotel in this place?" he asked.</p>

<p>"There's the Anchor, sir," answered the porter. "It's a rare good place,
an' they say as 'ow Lord Nelson stayed there once. They aren't very busy
at this time of the year. Only one or two motorists stopping there."</p>

<p>"What's good enough for Nelson is good enough for me. Is it far, or can
you carry that bag there?"</p>

<p>The porter hastened to reassure the gentleman. It was a bare three
minutes' walk. Might he ask if the gentleman was staying long?</p>

<p>Foyle wasn't sure. It depended on how he liked the country and on the
weather. "By the way," he went on, with an air of one faintly curious,
"didn't Mr. Grell, who was murdered in London, have some property<!-- Page 295 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span> this
way? Dalehurst Grange or something? I suppose you never saw him?"</p>

<p>"That I 'ave," asserted the porter, eager to associate himself, however
remotely, with the tragedy. "I've seen him time and again. He always
used this station when he came down from London&mdash;though that wasn't
often, worse luck. He was a nice sort of gentleman, though some of the
folks down here pretended that 'e was not what you'd call in proper
society, because he was an American. But I always found 'im generous and
free-'anded. And to think of 'im being done to death! My missus says
she's afraid to go to bed afore I go off duty now. It was a great shock
to us, that murder."</p>

<p>He spoke with a solemn shake of the head, as though he lived in daily
dread of assassination himself. "You see the last train through, I
suppose?" asked Foyle irrelevantly.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. The ten-nine up. As I was saying, what with these 'ere
murders and things&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Have they shut the Grange up, or is there still some one living there?"</p>

<p>"Well, they got rid of most of the servants. I believe there's still a
'ousekeeper there and a maid, as well as a gardener. I remember when Mr.
Grell first took over the place, Bill Ellis&mdash;'e's the blacksmith&mdash;ses to
me&mdash;&mdash;" He entered into lengthy reminiscence, to which Foyle only paid
casual heed. He had learned what he wanted to know. Grell, if he had
left the neighbourhood the preceding night, had not done so from
Deepnook, where he would have infallibly been recognised.<!-- Page 296 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span></p>

<p>The porter was still talking when they passed under the branching arms
of the giant chestnut that shaded the courtyard of one of the prettiest
of the old coaching inns of England. Foyle slipped a shilling into his
guide's hand, and registered himself as "Alfred Frampton&mdash;London."</p>

<p>Local gossip is often of service to the man who knows how to lead it
into the right channels. The superintendent decided that an hour or two
might be profitably wasted in the lounge, where half-a-dozen men were
sitting at a small table before a huge, open fireplace. He ordered a
drink and sat a little apart, relying on their provincial curiosity to
presently drag him into the conversation. By the time the lunch he had
ordered for one o'clock was ready, his habit of handling men had stood
him in good stead. "Mr. Frampton of London" had paid for drinks, told
half-a-dozen good stories, laughed at a score of bad ones, asked many
innocent questions, and deftly given the impression that he was a London
business man in search of a few weeks' rest from overstrain. Moreover,
he had gained some knowledge of the lay of the country and acquaintances
who might be useful. One never knew.</p>

<p>The afternoon saw him tramping through the picturesque countryside, with
its drooping hills and wooded valleys. He moved as one careless of time,
whose only object was to see the country. Once he stayed to talk with a
stone-breaker by the side of the wood; once he led a farmer's restive
horse and trap by a traction engine. On both occasions he contrived to
drop a good deal of information about himself, and his reasons for being
in that part of the country. That it was false<!-- Page 297 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span> was little matter. The
best way to stop local gossip is to feed it. A mysterious quiet stranger
would be speculated about, the amiable business man from London with a
love of chat was quite unlikely to arouse suspicions.</p>

<p>Sooner or later Grell, if he were in the neighbourhood, would learn of
the presence of Green and Malley. His attention would be concentrated on
what they were doing. Foyle, acting independently, was looking for an
opening to attack from the rear. He had a great opinion of Grell's
capacity for getting out of awkward situations.</p>

<p>He sauntered through Dalehurst, stopping at a little general store to
buy some tobacco and gather more gossip. The village shop invariably
focuses village gossip. A garrulous old dame talked at large with the
affable stranger, and when the superintendent emerged he was certain
that Chief Inspector Green and those acting with him had succeeded in
maintaining an adequate discretion in regard to the events of the
preceding night.</p>

<p>As Foyle passed on, he observed a man hurrying towards him and
recognised Malley. Abruptly the superintendent turned his back and,
leaning his arms upon a low stone wall, seemed lost in contemplation of
a little churchyard. When the divisional inspector had passed on, Foyle
resumed his walk.</p>

<p>It cost him some little trouble to find the road in which the motor-car
had been left derelict. The sodden earth still retained wheel tracks,
and it needed but a glance to show that the car had been removed but a
few hours before. He walked on till he came to the<!-- Page 298 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span> place where Green
had found the strip of brown cloth, which was fairly plain to find, for
the footsteps of Green and the other police officers when they followed
the trail ceased there as Grell's had done.</p>

<p>Here he drew a small pocket-compass from his waistcoat pocket, and
pressing a spring released the needle. As it came to rest he thrust
aside the hazel bushes and plunged in among the undergrowth. Now and
again he consulted the compass as he walked leisurely forward, wet
branches brushing his face and whipping at his clothes. For the brief
portion of the way a keeper's path facilitated his progress, but at last
he was forced to abandon this and return to the wilder portion of the
wood. He was making a detour which he hoped would lead him to the back
of Dalehurst Grange.</p>

<p>At last he could see a clear space ahead of him, and in a little,
sinking on his knees on a bank, was peering downhill to an
old-fashioned, Jacobean manor-house, from whose chimney smoke was lazily
wreathing upward. Between him and the house a meadow sloped for a
hundred yards, and the back of the house was bounded by an irregular
orchard.</p>

<p>"Pity I didn't think to bring a pair of field-glasses," muttered Foyle,
as his eyes swept the place. "I can't tell how those mullioned windows
are protected. Well, I may as well make myself comfortable, I suppose."</p>

<p>A little search rewarded him with a great oak tree, and in the fork of a
branch twenty feet high he found an easy seat from which he could watch
the house without any great risk of being seen himself. Immobile as a
statue, he remained till long after dusk had fallen and a steady light
appeared at one of the windows.<!-- Page 299 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span> It was, in fact, ten o'clock, and the
light had disappeared when he dropped quietly to earth and, with quick
footsteps, began to cross the meadow to the orchard.</p>

<p>Under the fruit trees the detective moved slower and held his stick
before him, softly tapping the ground as though he were blind. He had
not taken half-a-dozen steps before the stick touched something
stretched about a foot from the ground. Stooping, he groped in the
darkness.</p>

<p>"A cord," he muttered. "Now I wonder if that is merely a precaution
against burglars or&mdash;&mdash;" and, stepping over the obstacle, he went on
cautiously feeling his way. Twice more he found cords stretched across
the grass, so that an unwary intruder might be tripped up, but his
caution enabled him to avoid them.</p>

<p>The walls of the house loomed before him. He stepped to the nearest
window and tested it. It was fastened tightly, nor could he see inside.
Foyle had no taste for the haphazard, and would have liked to be certain
of the run of the house. But one window was as good as another in the
circumstances. He worked deftly with a glazier's diamond for a while,
and at last removing one of the diamond panes of glass thrust his hand
through and undid the latch. The window swung open, and the
superintendent sat down on the grass underneath and swiftly unlaced his
boots.</p>

<p>In another two minutes he was inside the house, and pulling an electric
torch from the capacious pocket of his Norfolk jacket, he swept a thin
wedge of light about the room. It was furnished as a sitting-room, but
there was no reason for examining it minutely. Foyle<!-- Page 300 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span> pulled open the
door and moved into a thickly carpeted corridor, which made his
stockinged feet almost unnecessary.</p>

<p>Door after door he opened and noiselessly examined with the aid of his
single beam of light. By the time he had come to a finely carved, old
oak staircase, he had a rough idea of the plan of the house as far as
the ground floor was concerned. The upper floors demanded more caution,
for there the servants might be sleeping.</p>

<p>The first door that Foyle tried after the landing was locked. Pressing
his ear to the keyhole, he could hear the deep, regular breathing of
some one within. Twice he tried keys without success. At the third
attempt the bolt of the lock gave. He pushed the door back and there was
a crash as a chair which had been wedged behind it was flung to the
floor.</p>

<p>A woman shrieked, and Foyle drew back into the shadow of the landing,
cursing his luck. Then there came the sound of rapid footsteps. The
superintendent drew himself together, and his muscles grew taut as a man
came running. A light blazed up as the man passed through the doorway.
Foyle caught one glimpse of a square-faced man fully dressed and acted
rapidly. He dashed forward and his hand twined itself round the other's
wrist.</p>

<p>"Mr. Robert Grell, I believe," he said suavely.<!-- Page 301 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XLVII" id="CHAPTER_XLVII"></a>CHAPTER XLVII</h2>


<p>When Heldon Foyle leapt forward, his whole body had been keyed for a
struggle. Whatever resources Grell might have in the house the detective
stood alone, so far as he knew. It was possible that Green might have
arranged to have the place watched, but, on the other hand, it was
unlikely that he would do more than have the roads patrolled and the
railway station warned. To have watched the Grange so effectively that
no one could get away from it would have taken a score or more of men,
and even so the position would have made it impossible for them to have
remained hidden.</p>

<p>All this Foyle reckoned on. He had hoped to find Grell and to catch him
unawares, perhaps asleep. That project had failed, and when the man had
replied to the woman's scream, Foyle had deemed the boldest course the
safest. Grell had wrenched himself round, the fist of his free hand
clenched, but he made no attempt to strike. An elderly woman sat up in
bed, surprise and terror in her face. Just behind Foyle stood two maids
in their night attire, shivering partly with cold, partly with fright,
their eyes wide open.</p>

<p>"That is my name," answered Grell, speaking as quietly as Foyle himself.
"I can guess who you are. If you will wait just a moment while I assure
these women that there is no need for alarm I will come down and talk
with you. You had better go to sleep<!-- Page 302 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span> again, Mrs. Ellis. And you girls
get back to bed. This is a friend of mine."</p>

<p>The maids retired reluctantly and Foyle linked his arm affectionately in
that of Grell. The alarm in the housekeeper's face did not abate.</p>

<p>"But who&mdash;who is he?" demanded Mrs. Ellis, extending a quivering finger
in the direction of the superintendent.</p>

<p>Grell lifted his shoulders. "Mrs. Ellis is my housekeeper here," he
explained to Foyle. "The maids didn't know I was in the place. It's all
right, Mrs. Ellis. I'll just have a chat with this gentleman. Don't you
worry."</p>

<p>He closed the door as he spoke. Foyle's right hand was resting in his
jacket pocket. "I may as well tell you, Mr. Grell," he said, "that I am
armed. If you make any attempt at resistance&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You will not dare to shoot," ejaculated Grell smilingly. "Oh, I know.
We're in England, not in the backwoods. Come downstairs and have a
drink. I don't want you to arrest me until we've had a talk. By the way,
may I ask your name?"</p>

<p>Despite himself the superintendent laughed. If Grell was a murderer he
certainly had coolness. But there might be some trick in the wind. He
was keenly on the alert.</p>

<p>"Foyle is my name," he answered&mdash;"Superintendent Foyle. I am afraid I
shall have to refuse that drink, and as for the talk, I may presently
determine to arrest you, so anything you say may be used as evidence. Of
course you know that."<!-- Page 303 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, I know that. No objection to my having a drink, I suppose, even if
you won't join me?"</p>

<p>"Sorry to seem ungracious, but even that I can't allow."</p>

<p>"Ah. Afraid of poison, I suppose. Just as you like. Well, here we are.
If you will let go my arm I assure you I will neither attack you nor try
to escape. Then we can sit down comfortably."</p>

<p>They had entered a room whose walls were lined with books and pictures,
apparently the library. Foyle shook his head at the other's request. Of
course it might be all right, but the man was a suspected murderer. He
would accept no man's word in such a case. "I am afraid it is
impossible, Mr. Grell," he said gently. "I am anxious not to seem harsh,
but you see I am alone with you and my duty.... If, however, you will
allow me, I have a pair of handcuffs."</p>

<p>Wide as his experience had been he could not recall a notable arrest
taking place in this way. He had fallen in with Grell's mood for many
reasons, but he chuckled to himself as he made the polite suggestion of
handcuffs. Grell did not seem to mind. His self-possession was
wonderful. Foyle reflected that it might be reaction&mdash;the man was
possibly glad the tension was over.</p>

<p>"By all means, if it will make you easier," he said. Foyle slipped the
steel circlets on his wrists, not with the swift click that is sometimes
written of, but with deliberate care that they should fit securely, but
not too tightly. The juggling feat of snapping a pair of handcuffs
instantly on a man is beyond most members of the C.I.D.<!-- Page 304 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span></p>

<p>Grell selected a chair and Foyle, watchful as a cat, sat by him. "May I
ask what you intend to do now?" queried the former.</p>

<p>"Wait till daylight and then send one of the maids with a message to the
nearest police station," replied Foyle. "Would you like a cigar? I can
recommend these."</p>

<p>He proffered his case and Grell took one. He held it between his fingers
with a whimsical smile. "Do you mind cutting it and giving me a light?"
he asked. "It's rather awkward with these&mdash;er&mdash;ornaments."</p>

<p>The superintendent did as he was requested and Grell puffed luxuriously.
Foyle remained silent. Although he was aching to put questions he dared
not. "Do you really think that I killed Harry Goldenburg?" asked Grell
suddenly.</p>

<p>"I don't know," confessed the superintendent non-committally. "I think
you may have."</p>

<p>"Yes. That's a pity," said Grell, lifting his cigar to his mouth. "This
affair must have cost you a great deal of trouble, Mr. Foyle. And it's
all wasted, because, of course, I had nothing to do with it."</p>

<p>"I want to know," said Foyle, a bit of American vernacular that came
from his lips unconsciously.</p>

<p>"Tell me why you never announced that I was alive?" asked Grell. "You'll
have to do it, you know."</p>

<p>"Well, there's no harm in admitting now that one idea was to make you
think that we were deceived, and so to throw you off your guard."</p>

<p>"And it did until you got hold of Ivan. Well, you've made a mistake this
time, Mr. Foyle. There were<!-- Page 305 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span> finger-prints on the dagger with which
Goldenburg was killed, eh?"</p>

<p>Foyle inclined his head. His blue eyes were alight with interest which
he made no effort to conceal. He half guessed what was coming, but he
found Grell's ways disconcerting and could form no certain judgment.
Certainly Grell did not behave like a guilty man&mdash;that is, a man guilty
of murder. But neither did he behave like an innocent man. He was too
totally unconcerned with the gravity of his position.</p>

<p>"Yes, there were finger-prints," he said. "I have a photograph of them
in my pocket if you would like them compared now."</p>

<p>"With mine? That's what I was about to suggest. You'll find some
writing-paper and ink in the desk behind you. I suppose they will do."</p>

<p>The prisoner smiled as he saw Foyle carefully shift his chair to guard
against any sudden rush, before turning his back. He was a moment
preparing the materials and then placed a blank sheet of paper on a
little table in front of Grell. "Will you kindly hold out your hands?"
he said. As Grell did so he smeared the tips of the fingers of the right
hand with ink. "Now press your fingers lightly but firmly on the paper.
Thank you."</p>

<p>He brought a little standard lamp closer, and under its rays studied the
two sets of prints closely. He did not need a magnifying-glass to see
that none of Grell's finger-marks agreed with the two that were clear on
the dagger. Grell leaned back in his chair as though the matter were one
of complete indifference to him.<!-- Page 306 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span></p>

<p>"Does that satisfy you, Mr. Foyle?" he asked at last.</p>

<p>The superintendent nodded as their eyes met. "It satisfies me that you
did not actually kill the man," he said steadily. "I'll own I'm not
surprised at that. I believe if you had killed him you would have been
man enough to have stayed and faced the consequences. You will observe
that I have not formally arrested you yet. But I do believe that you
know all about the crime&mdash;that you were perhaps an eye-witness."</p>

<p>For the first time during the interview Robert Grell lost hold of his
self-control. His fists clenched and the steel of the handcuffs bit deep
into his wrists as he momentarily forgot that he was handcuffed. There
was a meaning in Foyle's tone that he could not fail to understand. He
caught at his breath once or twice and his temples flamed scarlet.</p>

<p>"Speak plainly now!" he cried hoarsely. "What are you hinting at?"</p>

<p>Slowly Heldon Foyle began to tear the sheet of paper bearing Grell's
finger-marks into minute fragments. He was calm, inscrutable. "I thought
I made myself clear," he replied. "To make it plainer I will ask you if
a man, famous, rich, and with an honourable reputation, flies on the eve
of his wedding-day, assisted by his valet, hides himself in a low part
of London, and associates with doubtful characters, whose friends abduct
and drug police officers, who uses, in short, every effort to avoid or
to hamper justice&mdash;has not some strong reason for his actions? Is it not
plausible to suppose that he is an accessory either before or after the
fact?"<!-- Page 307 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span></p>

<p>Grell sighed as if in relief, and, stooping, picked up his cigar, which
had fallen on the carpet. He had recovered his calm. "You are a better
judge of evidence than I am," he said unemotionally. "Personally, I
don't think the facts you have mentioned would convict me of anything
but eccentricity. Who is this Harry Goldenburg, anyway? Beyond the fact
that he's my double I know nothing of him. That's certainly a
coincidence, but why on earth I should conceal anything I know is beyond
me."</p>

<p>"You're talking nonsense, Mr. Grell, and you know it," said Foyle, with
a weary little gesture. "There's too much to be explained away by
coincidence. We know who Harry Goldenburg was, and that there was a
strong motive for your wishing him out of the way." He leaned over a
little table and his face was close to Grell's. "You can only delay, you
cannot prevent justice by keeping your mouth shut."</p>

<p>The firm lines of Grell's mouth grew obstinate. "I shall stick to my
story," he said. And then, with a return to his former flippancy of
manner, "You're a clever man, Mr. Foyle. I never realised till you and
your men were on my heels how hard a time a professional criminal must
have. Even now I am not clear how you knew I was down here. When I found
the police in charge of the motor-car I had left I thought they were
merely guarding it as a derelict. I did not guess that you knew I had
escaped from London in it."</p>

<p>"A mere question of organisation," said Foyle. "As a matter of fact, we
know most of your movements from the time you left Sir Ralph Fairfield's
flat to the moment you separated from Lady Eileen at Kingston.<!-- Page 308 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span> By the
way, she made some money over to you. You may care to know that that was
got by forgery."</p>

<p>Surprise had leapt into Grell's face as the superintendent drily
recounted his movements. It was succeeded by a flash of fury at the last
words. "Be careful, sir," he said tensely. "You need not lie to me."</p>

<p>"It is the simple truth. Lady Eileen got a note from you asking for
money. She had none, and her father was out, so she signed a cheque in
his name and cashed it personally."</p>

<p>Grell's face had become grey and he buried it in his hands. His
shoulders shook and Foyle could understand how hardly he had been hit.
To have had to appeal to the girl for monetary help was bad enough. To
find that she had committed a crime to help him was to add an anguish to
his feelings that he had not known before. Somewhere in the house a
clock struck midnight, the slow, deep strokes reverberating heavily.</p>

<p>"She did <i>that</i>&mdash;for me!" said Grell, lifting his head, haggard and wan.
Then, as a thought occurred to him, "She is not under arrest?"</p>

<p>"No. I had her word that she would inform her father."</p>

<p>Grell made no answer. He stared moodily in front of him. The
superintendent had no desire to break in on his reverie. He walked
across the room, picked up a magazine, and sat down, again facing his
prisoner, while he idly turned over the pages. Presently Grell's head
drooped forward.</p>

<p>He was asleep.<!-- Page 309 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XLVIII" id="CHAPTER_XLVIII"></a>CHAPTER XLVIII</h2>


<p>The hours dragged wearily with Foyle. The soft breathing of the sleeping
man as he rested with his head pillowed on his arms was the only sound
that broke the stillness of the night. The superintendent himself dared
not sleep. He tried to read, but the magazines failed to interest him.
He got up and quietly strolled about the room, examining the bookcases
with incurious interest.</p>

<p>His thoughts were busy. Apart from all the other facts, Grell's manner
was more than sufficient confirmation of the fact that he was holding
something back&mdash;something vital to the success of the investigation. The
superintendent had a very shrewd idea of his reasons. Grell was a strong
man&mdash;a man likely to hold to his own line at all costs. He had already
proved that no personal considerations would move him.</p>

<p>The superintendent reviewed the situation impartially, his brow
furrowed, his lips tight pressed together. He was as certain as though
he held the other's signed confession that Robert Grell had it in his
power to say who killed Goldenburg. How would he break through his
silence? For, come what might, he felt that Grell's place was rather in
the witness-box than in the dock. That he preferred the dock was proof
of the strength of the motive which actuated him. No amount of
persuasion, Foyle knew, would make him open his<!-- Page 310 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span> lips. Disgrace by the
fear of a public trial had failed to move him. If he was to be induced
to tell his secret it must be by strategy.</p>

<p>Heldon Foyle held his own code of ethics in his profession. In his own
mind he held that all things which were legal were permissible in
facilitating the ends of justice. Grell could, if he were so minded,
give sworn evidence on what Foyle could only suspect. Grimly the
superintendent resolved that in a contest of will he would win.</p>

<p>A gentle tap at the door broke his train of reflection, and the white
face of the housekeeper peered in. Her eyes rested first on the sleeping
man, but his attitude concealed the handcuffs. She turned a
half-frightened glance on Foyle.</p>

<p>"Excuse me, sir. I couldn't sleep, so I dressed, and thought I would
look in to see if Mr. Grell or you would like anything. Perhaps a cup of
coffee&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, thank you," said the superintendent. "By the way, now you're here
you'll perhaps tell me whether you expected Mr. Grell's arrival. Didn't
you think he was dead?"</p>

<p>She advanced a little into the room, closing the door behind her. "That
I did, sir," she answered timorously. "I couldn't make it out when I got
his telegram from Liverpool. It gave me a shock."</p>

<p>"From Liverpool?" repeated Foyle slowly. "So he sent a wire from
Liverpool, did he? Would you mind if I had a look at it?"</p>

<p>He could see the hesitation in her face and went on: "See here, Mrs.
Ellis, there has been a murder, though, fortunately, Mr. Grell was not
the victim. I am inter<!-- Page 311 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>ested in the matter, and you will be acting in
his interests if you show it to me."</p>

<p>"I don't know what to do, I'm sure," quavered the woman irresolutely. "I
was supposed to have burnt it. Hadn't I better wake him up, and then he
can let you look if he likes?"</p>

<p>A strong hand pushed her back as she would have endeavoured to rouse
Grell. "I shouldn't worry him if I were you," said Foyle. "You may take
it that I have a right to see that message."</p>

<p>He spoke authoritatively. Her hand fumbled beneath her apron and she
produced a buff-coloured envelope. The detective took out and unfolded
the wire. He read&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"Mrs. Ellis, Dalehurst Grange, Dalehurst.&mdash;There has been mistake
of identity. Am safe and well. Shall be down this evening, but time
uncertain. Please have room ready. Let no one know you have heard
from me. Burn this.&mdash;R.&nbsp;G."</p></blockquote>

<p>The detective refolded the telegram and placed it in his waistcoat
pocket. His mind dwelt more on the significance of its dispatch from
Liverpool than on the message itself. The Princess had been at
Liverpool. It was a plausible presumption that she had sent the wire and
that she therefore must have been in touch with Grell.</p>

<p>"Yes, I guess you must have been a bit startled when you got that," he
said. "Did Mr. Grell give any explanation when he came?"</p>

<p>"Yes, in a way. He got here an hour or two after<!-- Page 312 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span> it came and must have
let himself in with his own key. He walked in on me while I was doing
some sewing in my own sitting-room. He said that the police had asked
him to keep out of the way, because if it was known that he was alive it
might hamper them. He told me not even to let the maids know that he was
here, and he came straight up to this room and locked himself in. I had
made a bed ready, but he has slept on the couch over there." She nodded
towards a big settee under the window. "He said the bedroom might do for
a lady friend he was expecting who might arrive at any moment. He told
me, too, that it might be necessary to leave suddenly."</p>

<p>The old lady had, it was evident, made a good guess at the identity of
her questioner or she would not have answered so freely, in spite of the
detective's authoritative manner. Foyle put one or two further questions
to her and then dismissed her with a quiet word of thanks. He began to
see that he had struck harder than he knew when he had descended on the
house in the guise of a burglar. Dalehurst Grange was, of course, a
rendezvous, and the Princess Petrovska was on her way to join Grell. The
superintendent rubbed his hands together as he thought of the surprise
in store for her.</p>

<p>Dawn was breaking over the woods when Robert Grell woke with a shiver.
He stood up and stretched himself. "Good morning, Mr. Foyle," he said
genially. "I'm afraid I dropped off, but I've had rather a wearying time
lately. Now, what's the programme? I suppose a bath is out of the
question, or"&mdash;with a glance<!-- Page 313 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span> at his fettered hands&mdash;"even a wash may be
dangerous. Faith, you don't believe in running risks!"</p>

<p>Foyle smiled in response to the banter. "Only a fool runs risks when
there's nothing to be gained. But I'm prepared to run one if you like to
fall in with a plan I've thought out. You're not under arrest yet. You
needn't be if you care to undertake to give evidence when the inquest is
resumed. For you are at present the only person who can clear up the
whole thing. Mind you, it would depend on what came out at the inquest
whether we should then arrest you. I can give no guarantee about it. But
if you accept, all that will be necessary is to quarter a couple of my
men with you for the time being."</p>

<p>Grell walked to the window and stared out upon the wooded country.
Presently he wheeled upon the superintendent with a short laugh. "My
dear man," he cried, "you will harp on that one point. I appreciate your
offer of comparative liberty, but if I accepted I should do so under
false pretences, because my evidence will be that I know nothing."</p>

<p>"You can't stop my knowing the truth," answered Foyle equably. "Sooner
or later I shall be able to prove it. And if you persist it will make
things much more unpleasant for you."</p>

<p>The other said nothing for a while. A struggle was taking place in his
mind that was indicated with a nervous twitching of the fingers. His
shoulders were bent and his head bowed. Foyle waited patiently. Outside
a bird started a "jig-jig-jig&mdash;br-brr" that set the teeth on edge. The
trees, stirred by a newly sprung up breeze, rustled uneasily.<!-- Page 314 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, it's no good," said Grell at last. "I know nothing."</p>

<p>The detective rubbed his chin thoughtfully. "Will you tell me if you had
any visitors on the evening of the murder?" he inquired, blandly
ignoring the other's refusal. He noticed a quick flash of surprise pass
over Grell's countenance and drew his own conclusions. Swiftly a new
thought came to him. "Did Goldenburg come to you alone?"</p>

<p>The prisoner remained silent, and Foyle knew that he was considering the
advisability of answering. "I don't see why you shouldn't know that, if
you want to. He came with a friend of mine. She left shortly
afterwards."</p>

<p>"She?" Foyle seized on the word. "It was a woman, then?"</p>

<p>Grell bit his lip. He had said more than he meant to. The superintendent
frowned thoughtfully, and his active brain was beginning to see things
more clearly. It was a full five minutes before he spoke again as one
making an assertion rather than asking a question.</p>

<p>"That would be Lola, of course." His blue eyes met Grell's frown with an
ingenuous stare. "This is beginning to get clearer, Mr. Grell.
Goldenburg was blackmailing you, eh? Maybe he had letters which you
wouldn't have liked Lady Eileen to see&mdash;what?"</p>

<p>An ejaculation came from Grell. The detective directed his gaze to a
picture opposite him, and continued, as though thinking aloud&mdash;</p>

<p>"Now I come to think of it, was Goldenburg a relative of yours? The
likeness is amazing. Well, suppose, for the sake of argument, he was.
And Lola&mdash;where<!-- Page 315 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span> does Lola stand? Was it to her, by any chance, that the
letters were directed? Was she merely a friend, or did she stand in
closer relationship to either of you?"</p>

<p>Grell yawned ostentatiously, but although Foyle had been apparently
looking away from him he had followed the effect on the other's face of
every one of the seemingly casual questions he had put.</p>

<p>"I am afraid I am boring you. It's a bad habit, thinking aloud."</p>

<p>"It does seem futile," agreed Grell. "You surely have little need to
exercise yourself about these things."</p>

<p>"Ah, you think so? I am beginning to think that something more is
necessary. It may be&mdash;of course, this is only for the sake of
illustration&mdash;that the dagger was handled by some one after the murder
had occurred. However, let the subject drop. Perhaps your housekeeper
will get us some breakfast while one of the girls runs into Dalehurst."</p>

<p>While waiting for a reply, he rang the bell and gave some directions,
with a note to the housekeeper. The breakfast that she ultimately served
up was a credit to her skill as a cook. Both men ate with an appetite
that the unusual nature of the situation did not destroy, though Grell
found the handcuffs troublesome.</p>

<p>The superintendent laid down his knife with a sigh of content.</p>

<p>The sound of a motor-car horn was borne faintly in upon them. In a few
minutes the housekeeper ushered Green and Malley into the room. The
chief inspector returned Foyle's greetings and flung his heavy overcoat
on to a chair. His eyes wandered over the prisoner<!-- Page 316 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span> with a little
pardonable curiosity. Grell bore the inspection with a smile.</p>

<p>"I congratulate you, sir," said Green. "We'll have the thing fairly
straightened out in a day or two now."</p>

<p>"I hope so," said Foyle. "Mr. Malley, will you stay with this gentleman
for five minutes? I want to speak to you in another room, Green."</p>

<p>He led the way to the little sitting-room, through the window of which
he had effected an entrance. A look of comprehension spread over Green's
face as he noticed the missing diamond pane. "Malley told me he passed
you in the village yesterday. You got our man quicker than I should have
thought possible in the circumstances. How did he take it?"</p>

<p>The superintendent gave a brief recapitulation of the steps he had taken
since he left London. Green rubbed his grizzled head and followed the
recital with keen appreciation. It did not occur to him to feel hurt
that Foyle had acted independently.</p>

<p>"As a matter of fact," he said, "I've got a search-warrant in my pocket,
and we were coming over this house to-day. I didn't anticipate much
profit, because he could have easily slipped away into the woods. I got
the county constabulary to put a cordon of patrols round about, and
hoped to drive him into their hands. But it was a slim chance. However,
we've got him now."</p>

<p>"Yes, we've got him now," agreed Foyle. "There only remains the
Petrovska woman, and we'll have her to-day. Listen."</p>

<p>He told of what he had learned from the housekeeper, and they discussed
the probabilities of the woman reach<!-- Page 317 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>ing Dalehurst Grange. If she
managed to escape Blake and the other detectives who were hot-foot on
her trail there was little doubt but that she would walk blindly into a
trap. That she had not already reached the Grange and departed Foyle was
satisfied, although she had had ample time to travel from Liverpool. As
Green phrased it, "she might almost have walked it." But the exigencies
of the pursuit might have brought about delay if she attempted to
confuse her track. If Foyle had been able to get in touch with Blake he
would have called him off in order to let her proceed unfettered. That
could not be done.</p>

<p>"She'll not dream anything's wrong here if we're careful," said Green.
"Will you wait for her, or shall I?"</p>

<p>"This is up to you, Green. I'll leave you. You might have had Malley,
but I can't drive the car myself, and I want to get back to town. Do you
think you'll be able to manage alone?"</p>

<p>"I think so," said the chief inspector confidently.</p>

<p>"I'll get the local superintendent to send up a couple of plain-clothes
men as we pass. You'll bring her straight back to town."</p>

<p>"Ay!"</p>

<p>In a quarter of an hour all preparations were finished. Malley was in
the driving-seat of the car. Foyle and Grell sat in the tonneau, and it
was no coincidence that the right hand of the prisoner and the left hand
of the detective were hidden beneath the rug which covered their knees.
For Foyle had handcuffed his man to himself. It was merely a matter of
travelling precaution. The superintendent did not believe that Grell
would<!-- Page 318 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span> attempt to escape, but there was no excuse for giving him any
temptation. Anyway, it did no harm.</p>

<p>"You'll charge him with the murder directly you reach town, I suppose?"
whispered Green, standing by the step of the car.</p>

<p>"Murder?" repeated Foyle. "Grell did not commit the murder. I shall
detain him a day before making any charge against him at all. Drive on,
Malley. See you later, Green."</p>

<p>The car whizzed away. Chief Inspector Green stood bare-headed in front
of the house, scratching his head, and with a look of bewilderment on
his face.<!-- Page 319 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XLIX" id="CHAPTER_XLIX"></a>CHAPTER XLIX</h2>


<p>It is permissible in certain circumstances for the police to detain a
suspect, without making any charge, for a period of not more than
twenty-four hours. Heldon Foyle had taken advantage of this to hold
Grell while he tried to draw further together the tangled threads of the
investigation.</p>

<p>He had changed out of his tweeds and, once more the spick-and-span man
about town, he sat down in his office with an order that he was to be
informed the moment that Sir Hilary Thornton returned. Meanwhile, he
occupied himself with a work of composition. It was necessary to break
gently to the public the fact that Robert Grell was not dead. But it had
to be done in the right way. He could not altogether see what evidence
might have to be offered at the inquest, but he was sure the newspapers
would label it "sensational." He wanted to prepare, at any rate, for the
revelation of the dead man's identity. That there was no possibility of
avoiding, but it could be rendered less startling if it did not come
suddenly. And beyond the public interest in the case Foyle had another
reason for the publication of his effort. He worked steadily and made
three drafts before he had completed his task. Two of them he tore up,
and the third he read over carefully, making one or two alterations.<!-- Page 320 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span></p>

<blockquote><p>"When the inquest in reference to the Grosvenor Gardens murder is
resumed it is understood that evidence of a remarkable nature will
be brought forward by the police. Inquiries made by the C.I.D. have
placed it beyond all doubt that the crime was not a planned one,
and evidence is still being collected against a suspected person.</p>

<p>"A man for whom a rigorous search has been made by the police has
been found in a Sussex village by Scotland Yard officers, acting in
conjunction with the county constabulary. He was taken to
Malchester Row police station, where he has been detained. It is
understood that he refuses to give any account of the circumstances
in which he took to flight.</p>

<p>"On inquiry at Scotland Yard yesterday, a representative of this
journal was informed that the officers engaged on the case expect
to be in a position to clear up the mystery in the course of the
next few days."</p></blockquote>

<p>"That ought to do," he muttered as he blew down a speaking-tube. To the
detective-inspector who came in response to his summons he handed the
paper. "Have fifty copies of that made, and bring me one. Put some one
to 'phone through to all the journalists on the list, asking 'em to call
here at half-past six to-night. They're each to have a copy of that."</p>

<p>There was guile in Foyle's fixing of the time. He knew that the
paragraph would be a bombshell in Fleet Street, and did not want it to
explode prematurely. At half-past six all the evening papers would have<!-- Page 321 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
ceased publication for the day. At half-past six, too, he would take
good care to be far away from the hordes of Press men, hungry for
details, who would strive to find more information from the hints given.
At that time they were likely to find any person wiser than themselves,
and he had seen to it that there should be no indiscretion at Malchester
Row.</p>

<p>"Sir Hilary just come in, sir," said some one, opening the door just
wide enough to permit a head to be thrust within; but before Foyle could
move the Assistant Commissioner himself walked in.</p>

<p>"One moment, Sir Hilary," said the superintendent, and dashed out, to
return again almost immediately. "I just wanted to make certain that we
shouldn't be disturbed. There's a lot to tell you. Things have been
happening."</p>

<p>"So I gather," said the other, settling himself in the arm-chair.
"You've got Grell, I hear. What's the next move? Do his finger-prints
agree?"</p>

<p>"They do not. He is not the murderer, but he won't say who is. The next
move is, that I intend that to go in all the morning papers."</p>

<p>He placed in Thornton's hand a copy of the typewritten paragraph, and
the Assistant Commissioner read it slowly through. "I don't quite
follow," he said as he handed it back. "It hints that Grell will be
charged with the murder."</p>

<p>"Exactly. It is intended to convey that impression. To tell you the
truth, I have a piece of evidence of which I have not spoken to you
before. It indicates a person possibly guilty whom we must not neglect.<!-- Page 322 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
If she is guilty&mdash;which I half doubt&mdash;that paragraph may help us to get
at the missing evidence."</p>

<p>His voice sank to a whisper and he leaned forward with arms outspread
over his desk. As he spoke, Thornton's voice changed. He leapt to his
feet and brought his fist down vehemently on the desk.</p>

<p>"I don't believe it, man!" he cried. "I don't believe it! It's
incredible. You've made a mistake. It can't be. Why, you've believed it
was Grell yourself all along. If you've made a mistake, then why not
now?"</p>

<p>Foyle's chin became a trifle aggressive. Thornton's astonishment was
natural, but the superintendent did not like the appearance of lack of
confidence. His blue eyes were alight. "You can draw your own inference
from the facts, Sir Hilary," he said coldly. "I am clear in my mind. I
have done nothing, because I want to make the evidence as to motive
indisputable. Should I find I am wrong I shall, of course, write out my
resignation."</p>

<p>Thornton was not usually an impulsive man. He had recovered himself
immediately upon his outburst and was once more calm and self-possessed.</p>

<p>"Don't be offended, Foyle," he said, more mildly. "I beg your pardon. It
was just a bit startling at first. We've been associated too long for
misunderstanding. I'll back you up, and there's not going to be any talk
of resignations."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Sir Hilary," said the superintendent, entirely mollified.
Going to the big safe he unlocked it and took something from the shelf
which he handed to the Assistant Commissioner. The two bent over it.</p>

<p>It was nearly two hours before the two concluded<!-- Page 323 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span> their task. Sir
Hilary, his hands clasped behind his back, walked in deep thought back
to his own room. Heldon Foyle put on his hat and coat and ordered a
taxi.</p>

<p>"Brixton Prison," he said to the driver.<!-- Page 324 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_L" id="CHAPTER_L"></a>CHAPTER L</h2>


<p>There are many people who pass Brixton Prison everyday who have no
conception of its whereabouts. The main entrance is tucked away a
hundred yards or so down an unobtrusive turning off Brixton Hill. Within
a little gate-house inside the barred gates a principal warder sits on
duty.</p>

<p>Although Foyle was tolerably well known to the prison officials, the
usual formalities had to be gone through, and he was kept outside till a
note he had pencilled was sent up and replied to by the governor. Then,
conducted by a warder, he was taken over the flagged courtyard and
through long corridors to the remand side of the prison.</p>

<p>Another warder opened one of the heavy cell doors, and a man seated on a
low bed looked up with a frown of recognition. The superintendent
remained standing by the doorway. "Sorry to trouble you, Abramovitch,"
he said briskly. "I just wanted to have a little talk with you."</p>

<p>Ivan rose and deliberately turned his back. "You must go to my solicitor
if you have any questions to ask," he said sullenly.</p>

<p>Heldon Foyle seated himself at the end of the bed and nursed his stick.
"That wouldn't be of much use, would it?" he asked smilingly. "What I
want to speak to you about has nothing to do with the present charge
against you. Mr. Grell is in our hands now, and in<!-- Page 325 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span> the circumstances I
thought you might care to know it."</p>

<p>The valet wheeled about and thrust his face close to the immobile face
of the detective.</p>

<p>"You've arrested Mr. Grell?" he cried. "Are you lying?"</p>

<p>"I am not lying. He is in custody and may be charged unless you like to
clear him."</p>

<p>Ivan took a couple of short steps. His lips were firmly pressed
together. The detective watched him narrowly as he came to an abrupt
halt.</p>

<p>"You think I can clear him?" he said slowly. "You are wrong."</p>

<p>"But you know he never committed the murder?" The words came sharp as a
pistol shot. Ivan never answered, and Foyle went on: "You have done all
you could to help him escape us. Now we have got him you can only help
him by telling the truth. There was some strong motive to induce you to
take all the risks you have done. What is at the back of it?"</p>

<p>Ivan studied his questioner suspiciously. Foyle made haste to dispel
what was at the back of his mind. "You had reason for refusing to speak
before," he insisted. "I'm not blaming you. Consider the thing fairly as
it stands now and you'll see that you best serve your master by perfect
frankness. I'm not trying to trap you. You may trust me."</p>

<p>The scowl on the face of the valet faded and his sloping shoulders
squared a little.</p>

<p>"You are right. Secrecy can no longer do good," he said. "I will tell
you what I know."</p>

<p>He sat down by Foyle's side and went on: "I was<!-- Page 326 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span> always what you English
call a bad egg. I broke with my family many years ago&mdash;it doesn't matter
who they were&mdash;and left Russia to become an adventurer at large. In the
years that followed I was everything everywhere&mdash;seaman, barber, waiter,
soldier, and gambling-house cheat. I wasn't particular how I picked up a
living nor where it led me. All that won't interest you. I was operator
in a gambling-joint at San Francisco when I first met Goldenburg, though
I knew him by reputation. He came to our place now and again, and we
were on speaking terms. After that Grell came and I mistook him for the
other man. That was how we first became acquainted."</p>

<p>"That would be almost five years ago?" interposed Foyle quietly.</p>

<p>"Just about that. They never came together, by the way, and Grell always
called himself Mr. Johnson. His own name would have been too well known.
Well, one night, or rather one morning, he had been winning pretty
heavily. He must have had close upon four or five thousand dollars in
notes on him. At the time I didn't attach any significance to the fact
that two or three of the worst toughs at the table went out shortly
after him. I followed about five minutes later to get a breath of air,
and came on the gang in a narrow, deserted street, just as they brought
Grell down with a sandbag. It was no business of mine and ordinarily I
should have walked away, but that I'd had a little difference with one
of the gang earlier in the day, so I sailed in with a gun, broke 'em up,
and helped Grell to his hotel. He came round before I left him, and I
told him<!-- Page 327 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span> my name, and he gave me five hundred dollars, telling me to
look to him if ever I was in trouble.</p>

<p>"Well, next day I was fired from my job. I could guess that the people
whose game I'd spoilt were at the bottom of it, but that didn't worry me
much. I had a bit of money and I came back to Europe&mdash;London, Paris,
Vienna, Rome&mdash;everywhere but Russia. I lived sometimes by my wits,
sometimes by any odd job I could turn my hand to. My father and mother
had both died, and my only living relative was my sister, a girl of
eighteen, living in St. Petersburg. From her I heard occasionally."</p>

<p>A spasm crossed his face as though some painful recollection had been
brought to his mind, and he passed a handkerchief across his brow, which
had suddenly become wet with perspiration.</p>

<p>"It was through her that I again met Grell," he resumed, speaking more
slowly. "She was alone and practically unprotected. She wrote to me that
a certain high official had been paying her unwelcome attentions, but I
suspected nothing till I one day learned that she had been arrested for
a political offence&mdash;she, who never knew the meaning of the word
politics. I knew what that meant.... At the time I was in straits
myself, for fortune had not been kind at the cards. This was in Vienna.
I was staring out of my window in a kind of daze when I saw a man pass
in a motor-car. It was Grell&mdash;the man whom I had known as Johnson.</p>

<p>"In desperation I sought him out&mdash;it was easy enough to find where he
was staying&mdash;and told him my story. I asked him to loan me money,
because I knew<!-- Page 328 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span> that I might have to bribe officials. He offered to do
more&mdash;to accompany me to St. Petersburg and use all his influence on
behalf of my sister.</p>

<p>"It was at his suggestion that I travelled as his valet. My appearance
had altered since I was last in Russia, but difficulties might have
arisen. We travelled night and day, but we were too late. The girl who
had never harmed a single person in her white life was dead&mdash;killed by
the hardships to which she had been subjected. I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He covered his eyes with his hands for a moment, and Foyle waited
patiently. Ivan controlled himself with an effort. "Grell advised me to
come away, but I was determined to stay for a while. I had work to do. I
told him nothing, but steadily I sought for the man who had killed her
as surely as though he had plunged a dagger in her heart. I found him at
last&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wait a moment," interjected Foyle quickly. "I want to know nothing of
that; that has nothing to do with me." He had guessed what work it was
that the hot-blooded Russian had remained to do. No man is bound to
incriminate himself.</p>

<p>"It was through Grell that I got away scot-free. No one suspected the
valet of so well-known a man. He asked no questions, though I could tell
that he knew what&mdash;what I knew. He risked much to shield me, although
never a word passed between us. Could I do less when it came to my turn?
I came back to England with him, and I remained his personal servant. I
kept my distance from the other servants."</p>

<p>"In fact, you pretended to have little acquaintance with English?"
interrupted Foyle.<!-- Page 329 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span></p>

<p>Ivan nodded. "That was so. On the nights when I was free, I wandered
about London and picked up a few old acquaintances, among them being
Charlie Condit. I shan't tell what I knew about him, but it was enough
to keep him civil, and later on he did what I told him.</p>

<p>"On the night that the murder occurred, I happened to be in the hall
about nine or a little after, when I saw a man and a woman through the
shaded glass standing on the steps outside. I opened the door before
they could ring. For the moment I thought the man was Mr. Grell, but a
second later I recognised Goldenburg. He did not remember me. The woman,
too, I knew at once. I had met her occasionally in different cities of
Europe. It was the Princess Petrovska. Goldenburg spoke of an
appointment and showed me a note from Mr. Grell directing that the
bearer should be shown to the study to await his arrival.</p>

<p>"That was enough for me. I showed them up and left them. I did not hear
Mr. Grell return, but about ten o'clock he rang for me and met me at the
door of his study. He told me that he was expecting a lady, and if she
called she was to be brought straight up; and he said the other people
were just going. Almost immediately after he told me she came. Wills was
going to the door, but I was in front, and I showed her up."</p>

<p>Foyle shifted his position a little. "Who was she?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I couldn't see her face; she wore a heavy veil."</p>

<p>"All right; go on."</p>

<p>"I knocked at the door of the study, but no one replied. She pushed by
me and entered, closing the<!-- Page 330 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span> door after her. I went away to my own room.
Whatever was taking place was no business of mine. I must have dozed off
in my chair, for when I was awakened by Mr. Grell shaking me by the
shoulder, he was white and quite collected.</p>

<p>"'Ivan,' he said, 'there's been murder. Come with me. Don't speak, and
tread softly.'</p>

<p>"I followed him into the study. All the lights were out, and before
turning them up he locked the door. As he turned the switch I could see
the body lying on the couch, and drew back. 'Who is it?' I asked.</p>

<p>"'Goldenburg,' he replied. And after a pause: 'He was a relative of
mine. I have killed him. You must help me to get away, Ivan.'</p>

<p>"He seemed profoundly moved and yet held himself strongly in hand. One
thing I noticed. Although he said he had done it, his hands and clothes
were spotless. And yet there had been much blood about the room. I said
nothing of that, and he quickly began to turn things out of his pockets.
Both he and the dead man were in evening dress, and he hastily
transferred all his property to the dead man's pockets, taking what
Goldenburg possessed. He picked up the sheath of the dagger from the
floor. It was one he had bought in South America.</p>

<p>"'It will give us a chance to get well clear if they think that this is
my body,' he explained. 'Go and pack a bag, Ivan.'</p>

<p>"When I got back with the bag, he had finished. He put on a hat and
overcoat and we went out, walked to Victoria Station, and from there
took a taxicab to Charing Cross. From there we walked to an all-night
Turkish bath establishment, and that gave us an oppor<!-- Page 331 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>tunity to change
into some rough tweeds that I'd shoved in the bag. In the morning we
went to the East End and fixed up rooms with some people I knew of. We
had come away without any money, but Grell somehow managed to get in
touch with the Princess Petrovska, with whom, apparently, he had some
arrangement. She had, it seems, booked through to Paris from Charing
Cross, but instead of getting on the boat at Folkestone had returned by
the next train and taken quiet lodgings at Kennington. That was to put
you on a false track in case of accidents."</p>

<p>Foyle smiled a little ruefully. "So that was how it was done," he
remarked.</p>

<p>"We were determined to get out of the country, but the reward bill with
a description of Goldenburg that pictured Grell stopped us trying
ordinary methods. It was necessary to raise money, and I, recklessly
enough I suppose, went out with the pearls which Mr. Grell had entrusted
to me, in the hope of meeting a jeweller, with whom I had a casual
acquaintance, at the restaurant, when you fell in with me. The
jeweller's letter which you found on me was, by the way, a forgery.</p>

<p>"When you seized me I was taken by surprise. When I was allowed to go,
after you had told me that the dead man was not Grell, I felt certain
that you would have me followed. Your men were very clever, and I could
not shake 'em off at first. I was determined to go to any length to
protect Grell, so I went into an outfitter's where there was a public
telephone, and put a call to a place where I was sure to find Condit. I
fixed up with him to wait for the man who was shadowing<!-- Page 332 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span> me, and I led
him down to Whitechapel. It was simple enough for Condit to drop on him
from behind, and then the two of us knocked him senseless, got him into
a cab, and carried him away to Smike Street&mdash;to the place which you
raided.</p>

<p>"Mr. Grell knew nothing about that incident till it was over. He was
staying in Grave Street at the time, and the idea occurred to me of
holding your man as a hostage. We meanwhile contrived to send a note to
Sir Ralph Fairfield. In case of accidents, I was to meet him in Grave
Street and lead him round about till I was certain he was not followed."</p>

<p>"Then you were the black-bearded man who fired at me!" exclaimed Foyle.
"I might have guessed it."</p>

<p>"And so you were the navvy!" said Ivan. "I didn't know that, but I at
once made up my mind it was dangerous to meddle with Fairfield if he was
watched. I gave him the slip, went back to Mr. Grell, and typed out a
note to you. You got it?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I got it. Where did the paper you used come from?"</p>

<p>Ivan's brow contracted into a frown of deep thought. "I forget&mdash;no&mdash;I
got it from Mr. Grell. He tore off a half-sheet from a letter."</p>

<p>Foyle was thinking of the finger-prints he had found on that notepaper.
Ivan plunged again into his narrative. "After that the Princess came,
and Condit. She had fixed up an arrangement with the people living in
the house that they were to declare her their daughter if inquiries were
made. I don't know if she slept there after, but she did that night. We
worked out a cipher in order to attempt to communicate secretly with
either<!-- Page 333 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span> Sir Ralph Fairfield or Lady Eileen Meredith. As I have said, the
lack of money was our trouble, and we had to get some&mdash;somehow. Condit
went away, and I persuaded Mr. Grell to go with him and spend the night
at a gambling-joint in Smike Street. I remained. You see, we guessed you
might want to examine the house, but we weren't certain. We were right.
As you know, I only got away over the roofs just in time, and the
Princess slipped away while you were engaged.</p>

<p>"After that it was a game of hide-and-seek. We decided that it was too
dangerous to keep your detective a prisoner, and sent him back in a
motor-car we hired. It was easy enough to make a false number to slip
over the real one, so that it couldn't be traced.</p>

<p>"It was my idea after that that Mr. Grell should become a watchman on
the river until we could get away by embarking before the mast. We tried
the advertisement method of communication and failed.</p>

<p>"The Princess undertook to see Lady Eileen&mdash;with what result you know.
You know all that has happened since. I do not regret what I have done.
If the killing of you or any other man would have saved Grell, I would
not have hesitated."</p>

<p>"Thanks," said Foyle drily. "You had a good try more than once. Now, are
you willing to have your statement taken down by a shorthand writer&mdash;so
far as it refers to events in London?"</p>

<p>"I'll repeat it when you like," answered Ivan, squaring his shoulders.
"Now you say that you want to prove Mr. Grell's innocent I have nothing
to hide. For I am certain that he is innocent."</p>

<p>"Tell me one other thing," said the superintendent.<!-- Page 334 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span> "What is the
association between Petrovska and Grell? Why should she have taken part
in this business?"</p>

<p>Ivan spread out his white hands. "That you must find out either from Mr.
Grell or her. I don't know."</p>

<p>Foyle drew out his watch. "All right, Ivan. I'll see you again shortly.
Meanwhile, I'll send some one along to get your statement. I don't think
you'll regret having decided to speak. Good-bye."<!-- Page 335 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_LI" id="CHAPTER_LI"></a>CHAPTER LI</h2>


<p>Both Sir Hilary Thornton and Chief Inspector Green were waiting for
Heldon Foyle when he returned to his office. The superintendent darted a
question at the chief inspector as he flung off his overcoat.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," answered Green. "She's at Malchester Row now. There was no
trouble at all. She came up to the Grange at half-past three, in a car,
and asked the maid who answered the door for Mrs. Ellis. The girl showed
her into a sitting-room, acting on my instructions, and I walked in on
her and told her I should detain her. She was angry at first, but in a
moment or two she laughed, and asked if Mr. Grell was taken. That was
all there was to it. I brought her back straight away by train. She
seemed to treat it as a joke, but never a word about the case did she
utter."</p>

<p>"And how did you get on, Foyle?" demanded the Assistant Commissioner.</p>

<p>The superintendent plumped into a chair. "I am sending a man up to get a
statement from Ivan," he said. "There's much to be said for that Russian
if his story is true&mdash;and I couldn't see any holes in it."</p>

<p>He related particulars of the interview that had taken place in the
cell. Neither Thornton nor Green spoke till he had finished. The
Assistant Commissioner smoothed his moustache, Green rubbed his head.</p>

<p>"Then Grell admitted the murder to Ivan?" said<!-- Page 336 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span> the latter, turning a
puzzled face to Foyle. "You told me he was not the murderer."</p>

<p>"Nor was he," answered the superintendent. "According to Ivan, there was
no blood on his clothes or on his hands a few minutes after Goldenburg
was killed."</p>

<p>"Well, this beats all," exclaimed Green. "I'm hanged if I understand!"</p>

<p>Foyle lowered his voice to a whisper, and Green's saturnine face became
a study as he listened. He gave a little gasp. "It lies between the
three of them," said Foyle. "I am inclined to believe that we have been
rather wrong in our first impressions of the finger-prints. But it never
does to take chances. Suppose you go and take charge at Berkeley Square.
There are four men there already. Lady Eileen has certainly had
something to do with this, and we don't want to lose sight of her."</p>

<p>Green went off, his lips puckered into a whistle. Thornton gave a shrug.
"And now?" he said. "It seems to me rather a deadlock if Mr. Grell and
the Princess remain obstinate."</p>

<p>"Yes," agreed Foyle. "It's one of those cases in which it is a pity
we're not allowed to adopt the French method of confrontation. Still,
there's a shot in the locker yet. Perhaps you might care to come along
with me and see Grell now. These disclosures of Ivan's make a
difference, and rather bear out a suspicion I've had since I talked with
Grell."</p>

<p>The Assistant Commissioner agreed, and in a little they were walking to
Malchester Row police station. The office of Bolt, the divisional
detective-inspector, was empty, and with an order that they were not to
be dis<!-- Page 337 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>turbed, Foyle and his chief entered the room. Under the escort of
a uniformed inspector, Grell was brought in. The superintendent closed
and locked the door, Grell moving stiffly aside to allow him to do so.</p>

<p>"Do you know Sir Hilary Thornton?" asked Foyle suavely.</p>

<p>Grell bowed. The Assistant Commissioner extended his hand. "How do you
do, Mr. Grell? I should have been glad to have met you under happier
circumstances, but I assure you that the respect in which I have always
held you is not lessened by this unfortunate business."</p>

<p>The prisoner shook hands doubtfully and his eyes flashed a questioning
look upon Foyle. The superintendent's face was blandly unconscious of
the effect of the Assistant Commissioner's remark, although the words
had been rehearsed and revised a dozen times during their walk to the
police station. But he had to do with a man as astute and ready as
himself.</p>

<p>"That's very good of you, I'm sure," said Grell, and a smile illumined
his face as he added: "Though I don't know why this matter should
increase your respect."</p>

<p>"Don't you?" said Foyle, laying stress on his words and eyeing the other
meaningly. "Suppose it is because since I left you this morning, Ivan
Abramovitch has made a full statement to me?"</p>

<p>A little apprehensive shudder swept through Grell's frame. His lips
opened to say something, but he checked himself suddenly. "What's that
to do with me?" he demanded quietly.</p>

<p>"A great deal, if it's true, as I know it to be. Now, Mr. Grell, you are
not obliged to answer any questions<!-- Page 338 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span> unless you like&mdash;you know that&mdash;but
I warn you that your failing to do so cannot prevent us arresting the
guilty person. We know you are innocent&mdash;though whether you may be
charged as an accessory after the fact or not is another question. What
do you say?"</p>

<p>The prisoner had leaned his arm on the table. His fists were clenched
until the finger-nails bit into the flesh.</p>

<p>"If you've made up your minds, so much the better for me," he said with
a half laugh. "Who have you fixed your suspicions on?"</p>

<p>It was clear that he had doggedly set himself to avoid affording them
any help. His chin was as fixed as that of Foyle himself. The strong
wills of the two men had crossed. The superintendent felt all his
fighting qualities rise. He was determined to break down the other's
wall of imperturbability. He accepted Grell's silence as a challenge.</p>

<p>Thornton's gentle, cultured voice broke in. "We are only anxious to
spare you as much as possible. You are a prominent man, and though you
must be brought in, it will serve no purpose to increase what will
create enough scandal."</p>

<p>"I fear you are wasting your time, gentlemen," said Grell, stretching
himself wearily. "Won't it cut this short if I admit that I killed
Goldenburg? I will sign a confession if it will please you."</p>

<p>The eyes of Thornton and Foyle met for a second. There was a meaning
look in the superintendent's, as who should say, "I told you so." Then
he took from his breast-pocket a piece of paper, which he unfolded as he
smiled amiably at Grell.<!-- Page 339 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span></p>

<p>"That is childlike. Your finger-prints prove it is false. Perhaps you
will tell us what underlies this note that you sent to Lady Eileen
Meredith the day you left London."</p>

<p>He read:</p>

<blockquote><p>"We are both in imminent danger unless I can procure sufficient
money to help me evade the search that is being made for me. If I
am arrested, I fear ultimately exposure must come. If you have no
other way of obtaining money, will you try to get an open cheque
from your father? You could cash it yourself for notes and gold and
bring it to me. For God's sake do what you can. I am desperate."</p></blockquote>

<p>He read it swiftly, as though certain of the accuracy of the words. As a
matter of fact, he was not. He had pieced together the broken words and
phrases that he had taken from the burning paper in Eileen Meredith's
room as well as he could. In filling up some of the gaps he might have
been preposterously wrong.</p>

<p>"Where did you get that?" demanded Grell. "Eileen told me she had burnt
it."</p>

<p>His words were an admission that the note was practically correct. Foyle
placed it carefully back in his pocket, while Grell stared at the opal
shade of the electric light.</p>

<p>"She did burn it," he answered. "I chanced to be able to retrieve the
message. I feel certain that, however dire your necessity, you would not
have written to her in that strain unless you had some strong reason.<!-- Page 340 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
Who did you mean when you said 'both in imminent danger'?"</p>

<p>"Ivan and myself, of course."</p>

<p>"Ivan was under arrest at that time. Nothing could avert the danger from
him. And you say that you feared exposure if you were arrested. That, of
course, meant that you would be unable to keep shielding the person you
are shielding?"</p>

<p>A dangerous fury blazed in Grell's eyes&mdash;the fury of some splendid
animal trapped and tormented yet unable to escape from its tormentors.
He glared savagely at the superintendent.</p>

<p>"I am shielding no one," he declared.</p>

<p>"You can, of course, make any answer you like. Suppose we go on to
another point which perhaps you will have no objection to clearing up
now. We have Harry Goldenburg's record. We know he had been blackmailing
you, and we know that he was your brother. No; sit still. He was your
brother, was he not?"</p>

<p>"My half-brother. How did you know that? How did you know he was
blackmailing me?" Grell spoke tensely.</p>

<p>"Oh, simply enough. The likeness was one thing, and a hint I got from
Ivan that he was a relative confirmed me in an opinion I had already
formed by another fact&mdash;which I observed when I saw you at
Dalehurst&mdash;that you had a similar walk. You will remember, I asked you
if he was a relative, but you would not answer. The supposition that you
were being blackmailed was borne out by inquiries made for us by
Pinkerton's, which proved that Goldenburg had visited you several times
and that he was always in funds after<!-- Page 341 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span> he left you, however low he might
be before. I think it is a fair inference."</p>

<p>"Quite fair." Grell's face was a little drawn, but he spoke quietly.
"You are quite correct, Mr. Foyle. As you know so much, there can be
little harm in enlightening you on that part of the story. I take it
that you treat it as confidential."</p>

<p>"Unless it becomes necessary to use it for official purposes, as
evidence or otherwise," said Thornton before the superintendent could
reply. "We cannot give an absolute pledge."<!-- Page 342 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_LII" id="CHAPTER_LII"></a>CHAPTER LII</h2>


<p>"Very well; I am content with that." The prisoner nursed his chin in his
cupped hands and stared unseeingly at the distempered walls. "It began
years ago, on a little farm in New Hampshire. That was my father's
place. He died when I was six or seven, and my mother married again. The
man was the father of Harry Goldenburg. I was eight years old when Harry
was born. Four years later, my mother died, and when I was sixteen I ran
away from home. You will know something of my career since then: the
newspapers have repeated it often enough&mdash;office-boy, journalist,
traveller, stockbroker, politician. I was still young when I became a
fairly well-known man. In the meantime I had not seen nor heard anything
of my brother except that he had left the village when my stepfather
died.</p>

<p>"In Vienna some years ago I became intimate with Lola Rachael&mdash;the woman
you know as the Princess Petrovska. She was a dancer then and had hosts
of admirers among the young men about town. As a matter of plain fact, I
believe she was employed by the Russian Government for its own purposes.
But of that I was never certain. Anyway she entangled me. And I believe
she really had an affection for me. It was during that time that I was
fool enough to write her letters&mdash;letters which she kept.</p>

<p>"Eventually I went back to the United States. I became a state senator
and became involved in politics.<!-- Page 343 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span> One day I was in my hotel in
Washington when I received a visit from my brother Harry Goldenburg. I
was in a way glad to see him, although he was practically a stranger. He
impressed me favourably&mdash;perhaps the fact that we were so alike
physically had as much to do with it as his suave ways and gentle
manners. Even at the time I believe he was suspected by the police of
being an astute swindler. Of that, of course, I was ignorant. He told me
a story of a mail order business he had established in Chicago which was
doing great things, but which was hampered for lack of capital. Well, to
cut the story short, I lent him five thousand dollars. A month later, he
wrote to me for two thousand, and got it. A few weeks after that I read
of a great fraud engineered in Central America and there was a
three-column portrait in the paper of the man at the bottom of it&mdash;my
brother. That opened my eyes. When next he came to me&mdash;he was audacious
enough to do it within the year&mdash;I charged him with living by fraud. He
laughed in my face and admitted it. When I threatened to call in the
police, he merely shrugged his shoulders and asked what I thought of a
flaming headline in the press:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%; text-align: center;">'BROTHER OF SENATOR GRELL HELD FOR BIG FRAUDS.'</p>

<p>"I could see it all just as he painted it. My political career was very
dear to me just then. Such a thing would have killed it. I knew if I
exposed him he was capable of carrying out his threat. However, I told
him to get out of the place before I threw him out of the window. He
could see I was losing my temper and took a little pistol from his
pocket&mdash;a Derringer.<!-- Page 344 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span></p>

<p>"'I have a number of letters which you sent to a lady in Vienna,' he
said. 'I know many newspapers which would offer me a good price for
'em.'</p>

<p>"I think it was perhaps fortunate for me that he held the pistol&mdash;or I
might have done something I should afterwards have regretted. He flung a
letter face upwards on the table. It was one of those I had written to
Lola Rachael. If he had the rest of the correspondence&mdash;and he swore
that he had&mdash;it would have been deadly in the hands of an unscrupulous
political opponent. As you know, electioneering in the States is rather
different from what it is here. I was fool enough to pay him money on
his promise to suppress them. He would not sell them outright.</p>

<p>"That was the beginning. After that I never had a secure moment unless I
was away on an exploring expedition. The moment I reappeared in
civilisation my brother would seek me out. He was cunning enough to
press me only to the verge of endurance. He could judge exactly how much
I would stand. At last, however, I resolved not to yield another penny
to his extortions. I cut loose from all my affairs in the United States
and came to England. I thought I could fight him when I had reduced the
stakes. I found after all that I had increased them, for I met
Eileen&mdash;Lady Eileen Meredith."</p>

<p>He paused. Neither of his two hearers said anything. An injudicious
remark might break the thread of his thoughts.</p>

<p>"When I became engaged to her," Grell resumed, "I knew that it would not
be long before Goldenburg would see his chance. I set to work to find
Lola, and discovered<!-- Page 345 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span> her as the Princess Petrovska. Then for the first
time I learned that she had married Goldenburg&mdash;but she admitted that
any affection she held for him had long since faded. They had parted a
few weeks after the marriage&mdash;which they both seemed to regard somewhat
cynically&mdash;and she had resumed her first husband's name. She admitted
that she had helped him to blackmail me, but apparently she herself had
handled little enough of the loot. She was vicious enough about it. I
gave her a cheque and induced her to come to London. I had it in mind to
stop this blackmail before I was married.</p>

<p>"As I expected, Goldenburg was not long in scenting profit. He descended
on me ravenously. I told him that I would pay him ten thousand pounds if
he would put all the letters he possessed in my hands but that I would
not otherwise buy his silence. He could see that I was in earnest, and
asked for time to consider. I gave him till the night before my wedding.
I said nothing of the Princess Petrovska. I knew that they would meet.
One cannot be too scrupulous in dealing with a scoundrel, and she had
her instructions&mdash;to steal the letters from him if necessary, while
pretending that she was only anxious to join forces with him in looting
me.</p>

<p>"But all her efforts went for nothing. He recognised the value of her
co-operation in the circumstances, but would give her no hint of the
place where he had concealed the letters. Time drew on. You will know
enough of her to recognise Lola as a clever, resolute woman. She made up
her mind to accompany Goldenburg to his appointment with me as a last
resort. It was to keep that appointment that I left Ralph Fair<!-- Page 346 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>field at
the club the night before the wedding&mdash;the night of the murder."</p>

<p>He breathed heavily. Thornton picked up a piece of paper and crumbled it
nervously between his lean hands. Foyle, eager and alert, was leaning
forward, anxious not to miss a word. A great deal of what had been
obscure was being cleared up. But so far nothing that Grell had said but
could be interpreted as a motive&mdash;and a singularly strong one&mdash;which
might in other circumstances weave a hangman's rope about his own neck.</p>

<p>"You did not want any one to know that you were absent from the club,"
remarked Foyle. "Why?"</p>

<p>"That was merely a matter of precaution. I wanted my interview with
Goldenburg to be secret. I had given Goldenburg a note which would
ensure his being shown to my study and I was purposely a bit late for
the appointment. I wanted to give the Princess Petrovska all the
opportunities possible. But when I reached there it was clear to me that
she had failed. He had not brought the letters with him. I got rid of
the woman, and Goldenburg and I quarreled. Then it was that I killed
him."</p>

<p>"And what of the other woman?" asked the superintendent.</p>

<p>"What other woman?"</p>

<p>"The veiled woman who was shown up to you by Ivan."</p>

<p>"There was no other woman," said Grell, his lips tightening. "I have
told you as much as I intend to."</p>

<p>"Just as you like. I believe you have told the truth up to a point, Mr.
Grell. It is fair to assume that a blackmailer of Goldenburg's calibre
would have taken<!-- Page 347 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span> precautions lest you should fail to comply with his
demands. Doesn't it appear a fair assumption that he might have taken
steps to arrange the presence of the person most interested, next to
yourself? He probably never mentioned that he had done so until it was
too late for you to stop her. I mean Lady Eileen Meredith."</p>

<p>The table crashed to the floor as Grell, the last remnants of his
self-restraint gone, leapt to his feet. Sir Hilary Thornton sprang
between the two men. Foyle also had risen, and though his face was
impassive the blue eyes were sparkling and his fists were clenched.</p>

<p>"You liar!" raved Grell. "How dare you bring her name into it!"</p>

<p>"This excitement will not advance matters," said Foyle placidly. "Sit
down for a little, Mr. Grell. You cannot prevent the inevitable."</p>

<p>The tense muscles of the prisoner relaxed and a shivering fit shook him
from head to foot. He could see the blow that he had striven to avert
falling while he stood impotent. He had taken every risk, made every
sacrifice man could make, to turn it aside. Now he had been told that he
had failed. It was not easy to admit defeat. His debonair courage had
gone.</p>

<p>Sir Hilary Thornton laid a hand gently on his shoulder. "My dear Mr.
Grell," he said, "I don't want to use the ordinary cant about duty and
all the rest of it. We may sympathise with you&mdash;personally, I admire the
attitude you have taken, though perhaps I shouldn't say it&mdash;but our own
feelings do not matter the toss of a button. Nothing you can do or say
will swerve us from what we judge to be the interests of justice."<!-- Page 348 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span></p>

<p>"Let me alone for a little while," answered Grell dully; "I want to
think."</p>

<p>They sent him back to the detention-room where, with a constable seated
opposite to him, he was to spend the night. Foyle rested one arm on the
mantelpiece and kicked the fire viciously into a blaze.</p>

<p>"Ours is an ungrateful business, Sir Hilary," he grumbled, "but I've
never come across a man who put so many difficulties in the way of being
saved from the gallows as Mr. Robert Grell."</p>

<p>Thornton took a long breath that was almost a sigh. "Poor chap," he said
reflectively. "Poor chap!" And then, after an interval, "Poor girl!
Couldn't you have dropped a hint, Foyle?"</p>

<p>The introduction of sentiment into business was a folly that Heldon
Foyle seldom permitted himself. With a shrug he pulled himself together.
He shook his head. "We've got to be more certain yet. I daren't tell him
too much&mdash;for my idea may prove to be wrong. You must remember that it
was undoubtedly Eileen Meredith's finger-prints on the dagger. At
present it is only surmise of mine how they got there. Finding the
prints on her blotting-pad, which I showed you, corresponded with those
on the dagger you gave me, was one of the biggest surprises of my life.
But we may clear it up now."</p>

<p>"H'm," said Thornton. "Well, we shall have to look sharp."</p>

<p>A thought struck Foyle. He stood rigid as a statue for a moment, and
then slapped his knee with sudden energy, "By God! I believe I've got
it!" he exclaimed, and jumped for the telephone.<!-- Page 349 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span></p>

<p>"Put me through to the Yard.... Hello! I want Mr. Grant.... That you,
Grant?... About the Grosvenor Gardens case. Tell me. Might the
finger-prints on the dagger have been caused by some one withdrawing it
and replacing it after the murder had been committed? Would the second
handling have obliterated first prints?... Blurred them. I see. But if
the person who first handled the dagger wore gloves? Thanks. That's what
I wanted to know."</p>

<p>He replaced the receiver and turned triumphantly on Thornton. "That
bears out my idea, Sir Hilary. Will you excuse me while I see if Bolt's
on the premises?"</p>

<p>Without waiting for a reply, he darted from the room. The Assistant
Commissioner's brow puckered and he thoughtfully replaced the upset
furniture. By the time he had finished Foyle had returned.</p>

<p>"Just caught him," he said. "I've sent him to collect all the men he can
find to make some fresh inquiries."</p>

<p>"I'm a little bewildered," confessed Thornton, jingling some money in
his trousers pockets and turning blankly upon the superintendent. "Do
you think you'll be able to do it&mdash;to bring this crime home to the
Princess Petrovska?"</p>

<p>"I think I can," replied the superintendent. "I was a blind ass not to
see it earlier. Lola's alibi&mdash;which is proved to be false, if what Grell
and Abramovitch say is true&mdash;helped to blind me. I was thrown off, too,
by the finger-prints on the blotting-pad, which corresponded to those on
the dagger, and also to those on the typewritten warning which Ivan sent
me. The only plausible motive for Grell's actions, if he was not guilty
himself&mdash;and that we are fairly certain of&mdash;was his desire to shield
some<!-- Page 350 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span> one else. There could be only one person for whom he was willing
to make such a sacrifice&mdash;Lady Eileen Meredith."</p>

<p>"Yes, I understand that. But the finger-prints on the warning?"</p>

<p>"They puzzled me for a while. But that was made clear when I talked to
Ivan. He had typed it on the blank half-sheet of a letter given to him
by Grell. That letter&mdash;it is only an assumption of mine&mdash;was one that
had been written to Grell by Lady Eileen. That clears that point."</p>

<p>"Still, I don't see how you have anything against Lola more than you had
before."</p>

<p>"There is this. The weak link in the chain of evidence against Lady
Eileen Meredith was the lack of motive. That was why I did not have her
arrested immediately I found that it was her finger-prints upon the
dagger. The strongest point against the Princess is the motive. She was
married to Goldenburg, but was not on the best of terms with him. She
was bought by Grell to play the part of Delilah to the blackmailer. My
theory is this&mdash;bear in mind that it is only a theory at the moment.
Grell, for some reason, left her alone with Goldenburg in his study.
There was a quarrel, and she stabbed him. It must have been all over in
a few seconds, and there was no outcry. You will remember that the body
was found on a couch in a recess, and you may have noted that curtains
could be drawn across to shield it from the rest of the room. Petrovska
may have drawn the curtains and slipped away before Grell returned. She
is a woman of nerve and would at once set about manufacturing an
alibi."<!-- Page 351 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span></p>

<p>"All this is very ingenious, Foyle," remarked Thornton, "but I don't
know that it sounds altogether convincing to me."</p>

<p>"It is pure surmise, Sir Hilary. Its chief merit is that it fits the
facts. Of course, Lady Eileen may be the murderess after all. I am only
working out an alternative. To carry it on a bit further. When Lady
Eileen came, Ivan showed her up to the room. No one answered his knock.
She went in and shut the door after her. It is my idea that there was no
one in there when she discovered the dead man. She was dumbfounded at
first, and probably the body being in the shade did not permit her to
see the face clearly. She placed her hand on the hilt of the dagger,
intending to withdraw it, but could not bring herself to use the
necessary force."</p>

<p>"Why didn't she call out?" demanded Thornton. "It seems to me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There is no accounting for actions arising out of sudden emotions. Lady
Eileen Meredith is as extraordinary a woman in her way as the Princess
Petrovska in hers. She had found a man murdered in her lover's
study&mdash;and she may have had a shrewd idea of the reason why she was
summoned there. You follow me? Probably as she stood there, hesitating
what to do, Grell returned. I think it likely that he stood by the door,
took in the situation quietly, and stole away with the impression that
she had killed Goldenburg. If she was bending over the dead man, that
was what he might naturally think.</p>

<p>"It is likely that he would make up his mind in an instant. To him the
fact that she had raised no outcry would be significant of her guilt.
She, let us suppose,<!-- Page 352 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span> stole away, having made no attempt to examine the
body closely and not daring to summon any one, for fear that Grell
should prove to be the murderer. He watched her go, already determined
to destroy the scent by taking the blame on his own shoulders.</p>

<p>"By the time she reached her own home reflection had shown her that
there was one possible chance that Grell might not be guilty. She rang
up the St. Jermyn's Club and asked for him. Fairfield answered,
declaring that his friend was in the club, but busy&mdash;too busy to talk to
the girl he was to marry next day, mark you. It is idle to suppose that
she did not appreciate the excuse as a flimsy one&mdash;one manufactured
perhaps for the purpose of an alibi. She must have gone to bed filled
with foreboding.</p>

<p>"All this is hypothesis. I am supposing that she never closely inspected
the features of the dead man. The next morning she is informed that
Grell was the victim. At once the lie that Fairfield told her assumed a
new aspect. She denounced him as the murderer. She dared not say that
she was the first to discover the body, for that would have meant
revealing that she knew he was being blackmailed.</p>

<p>"Then the Princess Petrovska paid her a visit and told her that Grell
was not dead but in hiding. There was nothing for it, in default of any
explanation, but to revert to the thought that he was the murderer. She
went to extreme lengths to help him&mdash;even to forgery. She believes him
guilty still; he believes her guilty."</p>

<p>"But Petrovska?" objected Thornton.</p>

<p>"I was coming to that. She is a clever woman. When Grell got in touch
with her the following day she may<!-- Page 353 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span> have had many reasons for assisting
him. She most likely had a shrewd idea of the situation and resolved to
profit by it to avert suspicion. While Grell was suspected she would be
safe. But it may have occurred to her that if we laid our hands on him
and he told us anything, we might get on her track. Suppose that to be
so, it is not difficult to see why she should take a prominent part in
assisting him. She would still have a certain amount of money, for he
paid her to come to England, and she, as we know, would stand at
nothing."</p>

<p>"It all sounds very interesting," commented the Assistant Commissioner,
"but it looks to me as though it may be a tough proposition to get
evidence bearing it out."</p>

<p>Foyle pulled out his watch. "My idea may all tumble to pieces as soon as
a test is applied. I can't pretend to be infallible. But we can try. I
am going back to Scotland Yard now, sir. It is ten o'clock. I expect to
be at it all night. Are you coming back?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't think I can be of any assistance to you. I shall be glad if
your theory does come out all right this time. The alternative
suspicions are horrible. Good night, Mr. Foyle."<!-- Page 354 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_LIII" id="CHAPTER_LIII"></a>CHAPTER LIII</h2>


<p>With his mind revolving the strength and weakness of his theory, Heldon
Foyle returned to Scotland Yard. He paused for a moment at the door of
the night-inspector's room.</p>

<p>"Anything for me, Slack?" he asked. "Has Mr. Bolt come in? Ah, there you
are, Bolt. Come down to my room." He led the way down the green
corridor, the divisional inspector following.</p>

<p>"Well?" asked the superintendent sharply, as he seated himself in his
office.</p>

<p>"I have seen the manager, a hall-porter and a chamber-maid at the
Palatial, sir. They repeat what they said in their statements before.
The Princess left the hotel at about ten o'clock. No one can fix the
time precisely, but it was certainly not before ten. She made up her
mind very suddenly, the manager tells me."</p>

<p>Foyle was rummaging with some papers. "Thanks very much, Bolt. Stand by
in case I want you. Tell Slack if he hears from Mr. Green to ask him to
leave things and come up to me."</p>

<p>He concentrated himself on the neat bundle of documents in front of him,
and gave his mind with complete detachment to the study of several of
them. The investigation had narrowed itself. Whoever was guilty was in
his hands. The choice lay between Robert Grell, Lady Eileen Meredith,
and the Princess Petrovska.</p>

<p>The reconstruction of the crime for the benefit of<!-- Page 355 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span> the Assistant
Commissioner, Foyle had purposely made provisional, but he was becoming
more than ever convinced in his own mind that, in spite of appearances,
Lola was the person at the bottom of the matter. She had left the
Palatial about ten. If, he argued, she had left Grosvenor Gardens
immediately after the murder it would have been possible for her to get
to the Palatial by that time and to immediately make arrangements to
leave. But for all that his intuition told him he was right, he could
see no way of fixing the guilt on her.</p>

<p>He placed the dossier back in a drawer and, lighting a cigar, paced up
and down the room puffing furiously. Half an hour after midnight Green
came in.</p>

<p>"Yes, it's worth trying," soliloquised Foyle aloud.</p>

<p>"What is, sir?" asked the chief inspector, stopping with his hand on the
door-handle.</p>

<p>"Ah, Green. I was just thinking aloud. Everything all right in Berkeley
Square?"</p>

<p>"Everything quiet, sir."</p>

<p>"Well, things have been happening since I last saw you. I want your
opinion. Sit down and listen to this."</p>

<p>Green selected a comfortable arm-chair by the desk, while the
superintendent went over his interview with Grell. The chief inspector
made no comments until the story was finished. Then he sat in silent
thought for a while.</p>

<p>"I've got faith in your idea, sir," he admitted at last. "It's likely to
be right as anything. But I am doubtful if we shall be able to get any
admission from the Princess."</p>

<p>"One never knows," retorted Foyle. "She's not under arrest yet&mdash;only
detained. We're entitled to ask<!-- Page 356 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span> her questions to see if she can clear
herself. But our best chance is to take her off her guard. We might go
along and wake her out of her sleep now and chance it."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The Princess Petrovska had been allotted a couch in the matron's room of
Malchester Row police station, partly to spare her the ignominy of a
cell, partly to ensure that she should be under constant supervision.
Her sleep was troubled, and she woke with a start when the matron roused
her.</p>

<p>"You must dress at once. Some gentlemen are waiting to see you."</p>

<p>"Waiting to see me? Who are they?" she asked. Her nerves were still
quivering, but her voice was steady and her face composed.</p>

<p>The matron had received her instructions. "I don't know who they are,"
she replied, in a tone that did not invite further questioning.</p>

<p>Lola, for all her iron will, found her mind dealing with all sorts of
possibilities as she dressed herself mechanically. It was not for
nothing that Foyle had chosen that hour for his visit. The sudden
summons at such an hour, amid unusual surroundings and the speculation
as to what it would be for, had upset the woman's balance.</p>

<p>She was taken by the matron into the same room where Grell had been
questioned an hour before. Foyle and Green sat at the table and, to her
imagination, there was something of judges in their attitude. A chair
had been placed at the other side of the table facing them, and the
lights were so arranged that while<!-- Page 357 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span> her face would be fully illuminated,
theirs would remain in the shadow.</p>

<p>"Sit down, will you," said Foyle suavely, when the matron had gone,
closing the door behind her. "We're sorry to trouble you at this hour,
but matters of urgency have arisen."</p>

<p>She strove to read their faces as she seated herself, but the light
baffled her. "I am quite at your disposal, Mr. Foyle," she said, hiding
her uneasiness under an appearance of flippancy. "What do you want?"</p>

<p>The superintendent balanced a pen between his fingers. "Mr. Green has
already explained that you are not under arrest," he said, in a quiet,
cold voice. "We are detaining you. Whether you will be the subject of a
grave charge depends upon your answers to the questions we shall put to
you. You must clearly understand, however, that you are not bound to
answer."</p>

<p>"That sounds serious," she laughed. "Go on, Mr. Foyle. Put your
questions."</p>

<p>"Very well. Do you still deny that you visited Mr. Grell's house on the
night that the murder took place? I think it fair to tell you that we
have had statements both from Ivan Abramovitch and Mr. Grell that you
were there."</p>

<p>He eyed her sternly. She made an expressive gesture with her white
hands, and her rings sparkled in the electric light. "I'll not dispute
it in the circumstances."</p>

<p>"You went there with Harry Goldenburg, your husband, in connection with
a scheme of blackmail he had conceived. You were to get certain letters
from him for Mr. Grell if you could?"<!-- Page 358 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span></p>

<p>She bowed. "You are correct, as usual."</p>

<p>"Mr. Grell left the room for some reason, and during his absence you had
an altercation with Goldenburg."</p>

<p>One slender hand resting on the table opened and clenched. She
contemplated her finger-nails absently. "Oh, no," she said blandly. "We
were always on the most amicable terms."</p>

<p>Foyle leaned over the table, his face set and stern, and gripped her
tightly by the wrist. "Do you realise," he demanded, and his voice was
fierce, almost theatrical in its intensity, "that you left your
finger-prints on the hilt of the dagger with which you killed that
man&mdash;indisputable evidence that will convict you?"</p>

<p>She shuddered away from him, but his hand-grip bruised the flesh of her
wrist as he held her more tightly. He had timed his denunciation well.
The strain she had put on herself to meet the situation snapped with the
sudden shock. For a brief second she lost her head. She struggled wildly
to release herself. His blue eyes, alight with apparent passion, blazed
into hers as though he could read her soul.</p>

<p>"I never left finger-prints," she exclaimed wildly. "I wore gloves....
Oh, my God!"</p>

<p>The superintendent's hand opened. The storm of passion on his face died
down. The woman, now with a full realisation of what her panic had done,
was staring at him in an ecstasy of terror. Green was writing furiously.</p>

<p>It was Foyle who broke the stillness that followed. "That will do, I
think," he said in an ordinary tone of voice, as though resuming a
dropped conversation. "Have you got that down, Green? Mrs.
Goldenburg,"<!-- Page 359 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>&mdash;he gave her her real name,&mdash;"you will be charged with the
wilful murder of your husband. It is my duty to warn you that anything
you say may be taken down in writing and used as evidence against you."</p>

<p>A hysterical laugh came from the woman's lips. She flung her hands above
her head and went down in a heap, while shriek after shriek of wild,
uncanny laughter echoed in the room.<!-- Page 360 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_LIV" id="CHAPTER_LIV"></a>CHAPTER LIV</h2>


<p>The blaze of electric lights under their opal shades in Heldon Foyle's
office became dim before the growing of the dawn. The superintendent, a
cigar between his lips, was working methodically over half-a-dozen piles
of papers. At the other side of the table Green puffed furiously at an
old brier as he compiled from the documents Foyle handed him a fresh
list of witnesses and their statements to be submitted to the Treasury
solicitors.</p>

<p>All night the two men had toiled without consciousness of fatigue. Their
jigsaw puzzle was at last righting itself. The fragments of the picture
had begun to shape clearly. Their efforts had at last been justified.
That alone would be their reward. The trial would show little of the
labour that the case had cost&mdash;only the result. The hard labour of many
scores of men would never be handled outside the walls of Scotland Yard.
They had nothing to do with the guilt or innocence of the Princess
Petrovska. When the case was handed over to the Treasury it would be
entirely straightened out, and it would be for them to present the
simple issue to the judge and jury at the Old Bailey.</p>

<p>Foyle flung away the remnant of his cigar, and drew out his watch. It
was nine o'clock. Sir Hilary Thornton, who had heard of the woman's
confession by telephone, might be expected at any moment.<!-- Page 361 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span></p>

<p>"That ought to do, Green," said the superintendent, as he strung tape
round the discarded bundles. "We'll have the lady brought up at the
afternoon sitting of the court. That'll give us time to talk it over
with the people from the Treasury. Yes, what is it?"</p>

<p>A man had tapped and opened the door. Before he could reply, a slim
figure pushed by him. Green rose to his feet and hastily pushed his pipe
into his pocket. Foyle raised his eyebrows and stood up more slowly.
Lady Eileen Meredith confronted them with wild eyes and pallid face. She
swayed a trifle, and the chief inspector with a quick movement placed
his arm round her waist and helped her to a chair.</p>

<p>"You are not well, Lady Eileen," said Foyle, slipping to her side.
"Shall I do something?&mdash;send for a doctor?"</p>

<p>She waved a slim hand in an impatient negative. "I&mdash;I shall be all right
in a minute," she gasped. Her throat worked. "I wanted to see you, Mr.
Foyle. I wanted to tell you&mdash;to tell you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Her voice trailed away in piteous indecision. Heldon Foyle whispered a
few words to Green, who nodded and passed out. The superintendent took a
small decanter from a cupboard, poured something into a glass, and added
some water.</p>

<p>"Drink this," he said sympathetically. "You will feel better afterwards.
That's right. Now, you wanted to tell me something."</p>

<p>A little colour returned to the girl's pale cheeks. Her hands opened and
shut convulsively.</p>

<p>"The paper&mdash;this morning!" she exclaimed incoherently. "It said&mdash;it
said&mdash;&mdash;"<!-- Page 362 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span></p>

<p>Foyle rubbed his chin. "It said that we had detained a man in Sussex,"
he said encouragingly.</p>

<p>She pulled herself together a little, but her whole form was trembling.
"It was Mr. Grell?" she asked eagerly.</p>

<p>He inclined his head in assent. "Yes, it was Mr. Grell."</p>

<p>Her face dropped to her hands and her frame shook. But when she raised
her head she was dry-eyed. The emotion that possessed her was too deep
for tears. She gazed in a kind of stupor at the immobile face of the
detective.</p>

<p>"You have made a ghastly mistake," she said, and her voice was level and
dull. "Mr. Grell had nothing to do with the murder. I killed that man. I
have come here to-day to give myself up."</p>

<p>A twinkle of amusement shot into the blue eyes of Heldon Foyle. The
girl, oblivious to all save the misery that enwrapped her, noticed
nothing of his amusement. But his next words aroused her.</p>

<p>"That's curious," he said slowly, "very curious. You are the third
person to confess to the murder. Really, I don't believe you can all be
guilty."</p>

<p>She stared at him in dumb amazement. Her tortured mind was slow to
accept a new idea. "The third!" she echoed mechanically.</p>

<p>"Yes, the third. The others are Mr. Robert Grell and the woman you know
as the Princess Petrovska, who in our police jargon would be described
as alias Lola Rachael, alias Lola Goldenburg." He smiled down at her as
she turned her bewildered face towards him. "So you see, there is no
great need to alarm<!-- Page 363 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span> yourself. The mystery is all but cleared up. If you
will permit me, my dear young lady, I should like to congratulate you."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash;" She struggled for words.</p>

<p>Foyle seated himself, and picking up a pen beat a regular tattoo on his
blotting-pad. He went on, unheeding the girl's interruption.</p>

<p>"I won't deny that if you had told me you killed Harry Goldenburg a day
or two ago, I might have believed you, and it might have made things
awkward. But there is now no question of that. We know now that it was
neither you nor Mr. Grell. If you had told us the real facts at first so
far as you were concerned, it would have simplified matters. However,
there is no reason why you shouldn't do so now."</p>

<p>The warm blood had suffused her cheeks. She had risen from her seat,
unable at first to comprehend the full meaning of it all. "I cannot
understand," she exclaimed.</p>

<p>"You will presently. Now, if you don't mind, sit down quietly, and tell
me in your own way exactly what happened on the night this man was
killed. Take your own time. I shall not interrupt."</p>

<p>A lurking fear at the back of the girl's mind that he was trying by some
subtle means to entrap her into an admission that would implicate Grell
disappeared. He dropped his pen. She searched the square face, but could
see nothing behind the mask of smiling good-nature. Her own curiosity
was alight, but she sternly suppressed it.</p>

<p>"You know about the letter?" she asked. "The letter I got from
Goldenburg."<!-- Page 364 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span></p>

<p>He shook his head. "Assume that I know nothing. Begin at the beginning."</p>

<p>"Well, that was the beginning. I did not know it was from Goldenburg
then, for it was unsigned, and both the address and the note itself were
in typewriting. It was delivered by an express messenger. It said that
the writer had something of importance affecting my future happiness to
say to me, and that I could learn what it was by calling at Mr. Grell's
house about ten. The writer advised me to keep my visit as secret as
possible."</p>

<p>"Ah! What time did you get the note?"</p>

<p>"I am not quite sure. It was about half-past nine or quarter to ten."</p>

<p>"Very neatly timed to prevent you making inquiries beforehand. Go on."</p>

<p>"I was perhaps a little frightened and the note piqued my curiosity. The
quickest way to learn what was wrong seemed to me to follow the writer's
instructions. I went to Grosvenor Gardens, where I was apparently
expected, for a man-servant let me in and took me to Mr. Grell's study.
I walked in by myself, not permitting him to announce me. The room was
in semi-darkness, but I could make out a figure on a couch at the other
end of the room. I walked over to it. The face was in shadow, and not
until I was quite close could I see the stain on the shirt front. It
took me a few moments to realise that the man was dead.</p>

<p>"Then I wanted to scream, to call out for help, but I could not. It was
all too terrible&mdash;horrible&mdash;like a ghastly dream. Gradually my wits and
my senses returned to me. It came into my mind like a flash<!-- Page 365 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span> that the
letter I had received hinted at blackmail. I could not see the dead
man's face."</p>

<p>Her voice died away and she looked a little hesitatingly at the
superintendent. He nodded encouragingly.</p>

<p>"Don't be afraid, Lady Eileen. You had found a dead man in Mr. Grell's
house&mdash;a man whom you suspected of blackmailing your fianc&eacute;. You not
unnaturally thought that he had been killed by Mr. Grell."</p>

<p>"Yes." She was speaking in a lower key now. "I feared that Mr. Grell in
an excess of passion had killed him. What was I to think?" She made a
gesture of helplessness with her hands. "My brain was in a whirl, but I
seemed to see things clearly enough. I dared not raise an alarm, for I
recognised that my evidence as far as it went would be deadly agamst the
man I loved. I laid my hand on the dagger to withdraw it, but at that
moment I heard the door behind me open and close quickly. I turned, but
not sharply enough to see who the intruder was.</p>

<p>"Then the idea came to me that I must get quietly out of the place. So
far as I knew I was the only person who could guess that Mr. Grell had
been blackmailed and so supply a motive for the crime. I slipped
downstairs and went home. You will understand my state of mind. At about
eleven o'clock I thought of a possible chance of speaking to Mr. Grell.
I rang up his club. Sir Ralph Fairfield answered. He assured me that Mr.
Grell had been there all the evening, but was too busy to speak to me. I
was unspeakably relieved.</p>

<p>"Then in the morning, he, Sir Ralph Fairfield, came<!-- Page 366 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span> to see me. I partly
guessed his mission, but the full shock came when he told me that it was
Mr. Grell who was murdered. I think I must have been mad at the time. I
said nothing about my own discovery&mdash;if Mr. Grell had been blackmailed,
I did not want any details to come out. Besides, it seemed obvious to me
that Fairfield had said Grell was at the club in order to shield
himself." She flushed slightly. "I knew Sir Ralph loved me. I thought he
was guilty and&mdash;and denounced him.</p>

<p>"I continued to believe that until the Princess Petrovska came to me
with a note from Mr. Grell bidding me trust her. I gave her my jewels,
and she told me he could communicate with me by cipher. I returned to my
first idea that he had killed Goldenburg&mdash;the Princess told me the
murdered man's name&mdash;rather than submit to blackmail. I determined to do
all I could to help him, for, murderer or not, I loved him&mdash;I loved him.
You know how our attempt to communicate by cipher failed.</p>

<p>"A day or two ago he sent me a note&mdash;a mysterious note&mdash;saying we were
both in danger. I could not understand that part of it, but it was clear
he wanted money. I could not get it except by putting my father's name
to a cheque. You know all about that. I took a taxicab and arranged to
meet him at Putney."</p>

<p>"You went to the General Post Office before that," interposed Foyle.</p>

<p>"Yes, I wanted to order a motor-car to meet us at Kingston. I thought it
safer to do it from a public-call office so as to leave as little trace
as possible. I picked Mr. Grell up at Putney, and gave him the money.
Neither of us referred directly to the murder during<!-- Page 367 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span> the journey. He
told me that he was making for his place in Sussex, and should there
make a plan for getting out of the country. He argued that the less I
knew of details the better."</p>

<p>"A reasonable feeling, under the circumstances," murmured Foyle. And
then, with a smile, "Your finger-prints on the dagger have been partly
responsible for a lot of bother, Lady Eileen. If you had followed my
advice at first&mdash;but it's no use harping on that. You have believed Mr.
Grell to be the murderer, I suppose, and made your own confession to
shield him. I don't know that I oughtn't to congratulate you both, for
he has certainly made enormous sacrifices, and taken enormous risks to
shield you."</p>

<p>"To shield <i>me</i>?" Her astonishment was palpable.</p>

<p>"To shield you. He had at least as much reason&mdash;if you'll forgive me
saying so&mdash;to believe you guilty as you had to think he was a murderer.
It was he&mdash;if my guess is correct&mdash;who opened the door while you were
stooping over the murdered man. He must have jumped to the conclusion
that you had at that moment killed the man, and took his own way of
diverting suspicion from you. That is the only explanation that appears
plausible to me."</p>

<p>A new light of happiness was in her grey eyes, and she smiled. The
direct common sense of the detective had brought home to her the motive
for the portion of the mystery that until that moment had perplexed her.
Robert Grell had laid down everything for her sake. And she had never
thought&mdash;never dreamed.... The voice of Foyle, apparently distant and
far away, broke in on her thoughts.<!-- Page 368 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span></p>

<p>"I have sent for Mr. Grell. He will be here shortly. There is still some
light that he may be disposed to throw on the affair&mdash;now. Meanwhile, if
you do not object, I should like to have the statement you have just
made put in writing. I will have a shorthand writer in and place this
room at your disposal."</p>

<p>She murmured some words of assent and he disappeared. In a few minutes
he returned with one of the junior men of the C.I.D., who carried a
reporter's notebook in one hand and a pencil in the other.</p>

<p>Heldon Foyle strolled away to Sir Hilary Thornton's room. The Assistant
Commissioner was just hanging up his overcoat. He turned quickly and
held out his hand to the superintendent.</p>

<p>"Congratulations, Foyle. I hear it's all plain sailing now. Come and
tell me all about it."<!-- Page 369 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_LV" id="CHAPTER_LV"></a>CHAPTER LV</h2>


<p>For ten minutes the two heads of the detective service of London were in
conference. Then there was an interruption. The door was pulled open
without any preliminary knock, and Chief-Inspector Green strode swiftly
in, with Robert Grell at his heels. Both men were plainly stirred by
some suppressed excitement. Green laid a note down in front of Foyle.</p>

<p>"Petrovska has killed herself," he exclaimed. "The matron found her
poisoned in her cell, a minute or so after I reached Malchester Row.
There was poison in one of her rings. She left this letter addressed to
you."</p>

<p>"Ah!" There was no betrayal of astonishment or any other emotion in the
superintendent's tone. He fingered the letter carelessly. "Won't you sit
down, Mr. Grell? No doubt you'll excuse us for a moment. Sit down,
Green."</p>

<p>He tore open the letter and glanced over the neat, delicate handwriting.
Thornton was leaning eagerly across the table. "A confession?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;a confession," he replied. "Shall I read it aloud?" His eyes
rested for an instant on Robert Grell. "You may care to hear it," he
added.</p>

<p>"Go on," said Thornton.</p>

<p>Foyle spread the sheets on the table in front of him and began to read
in a steady, expressionless tone.</p>

<p>"Heldon Foyle, Esq., Superintendent, C.I.D., New Scotland Yard,
S.W.&mdash;Sir,&mdash;It would be futile, after<!-- Page 370 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span> what happened this morning, to
dispute any longer the correctness of the conclusions you have come to.
I killed Harry Goldenburg, and there is no need for any cant about
repentance. He deserved all he got. As for myself, I was fool enough to
step into a trap, and there is only one way out. I ought to have beaten
you, but as I failed, it may interest you to know the bare facts.</p>

<p>"Goldenburg was, as you guessed, my husband, though it was long since we
had lived together. Before I met him, however, I had become acquainted
with Mr. Grell&mdash;I think it was in Vienna. I was on the stage there, and
had a circle of admirers, of whom he became one. Whether you believe it
or not, I assure you, on the word of a dying woman, there was nothing
harmful in our intimacy. But letters passed, and his I kept.</p>

<p>"He disappeared out of my life after a while, and ultimately I met
Goldenburg. We were both living on our wits. I, of course, could not
fail to be struck by his astonishing likeness to Mr. Grell, and he told
me eventually of their relationship. There is no use beating about the
bush. Other people than Grell had written to me in the old days, and I
had my own methods of forcing them to keep me silent. In plain words, a
great part of my living was by blackmail, but I naturally acted very
delicately. Harry Goldenburg wormed his way into my confidence, and it
occurred to me that such a man would be an invaluable ally.</p>

<p>"We worked together for a while&mdash;I forgot to say we had been
married&mdash;and I entrusted him with all the letters I had&mdash;including
Grell's. Even the keenest<!-- Page 371 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span> woman will be a fool sometimes. You will
guess what happened. He saw no need to share his plunder with me, and he
left me. There was no open quarrel, but I determined that some day I
would get even. But on the few occasions we met afterwards I preserved a
friendly attitude. I even helped him in certain affairs.</p>

<p>"Then there came the time when Mr. Grell sought me out and paid me to
attempt to recover his letters. I jumped at the chance, for apart from
the money it seemed a fine opportunity to score off Goldenburg. I hadn't
much difficulty in getting in touch with him when he reached London. He
thought&mdash;and I encouraged the thought&mdash;that, like himself, I had been
attracted here by the prospect of bleeding Grell on the eve of his
marriage. I proposed a business partnership, and he, probably laughing
in his sleeve, agreed. He had no intention of paying me my share, but he
thought I might be useful in case the threat of publishing the letters
might not be enough.</p>

<p>"But I never got the letters, although I used every means that occurred
to me. I even suggested that he should entrust them to me so that I
might try to extort money by their means from Lady Eileen Meredith. He
would have none of it. I changed my ground and arranged to accompany him
on what was to be the final decisive interview with Grell on his wedding
eve.</p>

<p>"I said little during the preliminary talk. Both men were firm.
Goldenburg declared that he would not give up the letters entirely.
Grell was equally determined not to pay unless they were given to him.</p>

<p>"When I at length broke into the conversation I<!-- Page 372 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span> asked Grell for the
letters I had written to him. I wanted to get him out of the room. He
must have understood my look, for he at once said he had burnt them, but
would make sure. He left the room. As soon as he was gone I played my
final card with Goldenburg. I knew that the time had gone by for
finesse; I told him that unless he gave up the letters I would suggest
to Grell that he should declare them forgeries, and that I would bear
him out.</p>

<p>"I think even Goldenburg was taken aback, for the revelation that I was
playing double came as a shock to him. He laughed at me at first, but I
could see that he had lost his temper. Then he swore at me for a
Jezebel, and half rose as though he would strike me. But I was first.
There was a dagger on the mantelpiece. For a moment I saw red. When I
was again capable of thought I saw Goldenburg lying on the couch,
motionless, and I knew what I had done.</p>

<p>"I struggled to get a grip on myself. At any moment Grell might return.
I could not be sure of what he might do, and my whole idea was to save
myself at any cost. Goldenburg had fallen back on the couch. I had taken
two steps to the door when there was a sound outside. I drew back behind
a curtain, expecting Grell. Instead of that a woman came in. She was
heavily veiled, and though I did not know her then I was positive it was
Lady Eileen Meredith, for Goldenburg had hinted at some such dramatic
surprise if Grell did not come to terms. I saw her stoop over the
murdered man, and then Grell opened the door. He stared for a second,
and then closed the door again just as Lady Eileen looked up.<!-- Page 373 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span></p>

<p>"To him it must have appeared that she had killed the man. I expected
her to scream, but she did nothing of the sort. She went out, closing
the door softly. I followed her within a minute or so, for I began to
have an idea how things might be turned to my advantage. I went straight
back to my hotel, and made arrangements to secure a sort of alibi. But I
wanted to know how things were going. I had told Grell that if it became
necessary to write me under cover, he might do so at the <i>poste
restante</i>, Folkestone. There it was I heard before I returned to London.
He declared that he had killed Goldenburg, a statement I had the best of
reasons for knowing was false. But it left me with an easier mind. I had
no wish that he should be questioned by the police, for that might have
given rise to questions as to why I was at the house, and how I left.</p>

<p>"That was why I helped him by every means in my power. I think now it
would have been perfectly easy for me to have disappeared without
raising more than a fleeting suspicion in any one's mind. But we cannot
foresee everything. And I believed that my safety lay in keeping Grell
at liberty. What he thought of my motives for helping him, I do not
know&mdash;he may have believed them to be gratitude, or something else.
Anyway, he trusted me, and to make sure, I more than once hinted that I
had an idea that Lady Eileen Meredith was the guilty person.</p>

<p>"It was I who supplied funds for the most part, and it was only when my
resources threatened to give out, that we tried other methods. When I
left for Liverpool, I was nearly at the bottom of my purse.<!-- Page 374 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span> The
arrangement with Mr. Grell was, that I should remain in hiding there
until such time as he could obtain money to enable us to get out of the
country. Then I was to join him. I got a wire from him at last fixing
Dalehurst Grange, and knowing that the stations would be watched, I
determined to motor down.</p>

<p>"This explanation should make the things clear you do not already
know,&mdash;L.P."</p>

<p>Heldon Foyle finished reading, and there was a moment's silence, broken
at last by a gasp from Grell.</p>

<p>"It was she, then, not&mdash;not&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not Lady Eileen Meredith," interrupted Foyle. "But do you confirm what
she says there, Mr. Grell?"</p>

<p>Grell reached out, and took the paper with a hand that shook. He scanned
it quickly, and handed it back to the superintendent.</p>

<p>"She is right in everything she says about me," he admitted. "I did
think&mdash;God forgive me!&mdash;that my own eyes were right. I believed that
Eileen had killed that man. That it was influenced me in everything I
did. Till this moment, I had no idea&mdash;&mdash;" He wheeled almost angrily on
Green. "Why didn't you say why you brought me here?"</p>

<p>The chief inspector shrugged his shoulders. "My instructions were to
bring you here&mdash;not to give explanations."</p>

<p>"I thought it best that you should learn all there was to know at your
leisure," interjected Foyle. "Of course, we knew nothing of this"&mdash;he
tapped the confession as he spoke&mdash;"before you came in."</p>

<p>Sir Hilary Thornton smoothed his moustache. "It<!-- Page 375 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span> has been an unpleasant
business for all of us," he said urbanely, "and particularly for you,
Mr. Grell. I can scarcely apologise for the trouble you have been
caused, for, frankly, you have brought it all on yourself, though
unofficially, I may say that I have never known a man behave with
greater courage than you have in this matter. I am afraid that some of
the things your fr&mdash;&mdash;, your associates, have done, will have to be
answered for, but anything consistent with our duty will be done for
them. Perhaps Mr. Foyle will tell us the story of the case now. You are
at least entitled to that."<!-- Page 376 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_LVI" id="CHAPTER_LVI"></a>CHAPTER LVI</h2>


<p>A deprecating smile came to the superintendent's lips. Robert Grell was
studying him curiously. He recognised that he owed much to the
blue-eyed, square-faced detective.</p>

<p>"Yes, I think I am at least entitled to that," he echoed.</p>

<p>Foyle gave a shrug. "As you like, gentlemen. You once complained, Sir
Hilary, that I talked like a detective out of a book. This kind of thing
makes me feel like one&mdash;except that, in this case, I cannot claim much
credit. I only used common sense and perseverance."</p>

<p>"Let us have it," said Grell. He was beginning to be his own masterful
self.</p>

<p>"Very well. It has all been a matter of organisation. You will remember,
that in dealing with an intricate case no man is at his best working
alone. However able or brilliant a detective is, he cannot
systematically bring off successful coups single-handed&mdash;outside a
novel. He is a wheel in a machine. Or perhaps, a better way to put it
would be to say, he is a unit in an army. He is almost helpless alone.</p>

<p>"There are many people who believe that a detective's work is a kind of
mental sleight of hand. By some means, he picks up a trivial clue which
inevitably leads, by some magical process, to the solution of the<!-- Page 377 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span>
mystery. I do not say that deductions are not helpful, but they are not
all. A great writer once compared the science of detection to a game of
cards, and the comparison is very accurate. A good player can judge,
with reasonable certainty, the cards in the hands of each of his
opponents. But he can never be absolutely certain&mdash;especially when he is
unacquainted with his opponents' methods of play.</p>

<p>"Detection can never be reduced to a mathematical certainty until you
level human nature, so that every person in the same set of
circumstances will act in exactly the same way. Like doctors, we have to
diagnose from circumstances&mdash;and even the greatest doctors are wrong at
times. Specialist knowledge has often to be called in.</p>

<p>"When this case commenced, specialist knowledge had to be enlisted to
fix our facts&mdash;and the one general difficulty which arose as always, was
that we did not know which facts might prove important. As an instance,
I may say that the finger-prints on the dagger were wholly misleading,
and might have brought about a miscarriage of justice.</p>

<p>"It was necessary that we should collect every fact we could about the
murder, whether great or small. That was one phase for the investigation
where organisation was necessary. A man working alone would have taken
months, perhaps years, in this preliminary work. Then luck favoured us.
Our records&mdash;collected, of course, by organisation&mdash;contained a portrait
of a man strikingly like you"&mdash;he nodded to Grell&mdash;"and a comparison of
finger-prints told us that the dead man was not you, but Harry
Goldenburg.<!-- Page 378 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span></p>

<p>"Previously, the time of the murder had been fixed by Professor Harding
as between ten and twelve. It was our business to find out who had been
with Harry Goldenburg at that time. Among those persons was the guilty
one."</p>

<p>"I can't see how that helped you at all," said Grell, his brows bent.</p>

<p>"In this way, and as a negative test. The alibi is a commonplace of the
criminal courts. Every person on whom clues might ultimately rest would
be eliminated from the investigation if it could be proved beyond doubt
that they were elsewhere at the time. You must remember, that we had not
only to find the murderer, but to produce evidence that would satisfy a
jury that we were right. But we worked, first of all, from such main
facts as we had. You were missing. Ivan was missing. A mysterious veiled
woman was missing. There was the pearl necklace that you had bought as a
wedding present for Lady Eileen. There was the strange dagger used in
the murder. There was the miniature of Lola on the dead man. These were
the chief heads. There were scores of minor things to be dealt with.</p>

<p>"The matter was complicated, too, by the dead man's clothes. In the
pockets, there were your personal belongings. A natural, but erroneous
assumption was that they were your clothes. There is not much scope for
individuality in evening dress. I confess I was misled and puzzled at
first, but a little thought afforded the explanation, and, in fact, it
would have been cleared up automatically in any event by the examination
of the garments.<!-- Page 379 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now, subtlety may be an admirable thing, but it can be overdone. I have
never believed that, because a certain thing seems obvious, it is
necessarily wrong. It was reasonably certain that one, or all of the
missing persons, had knowledge of what had happened. It was extremely
probable that one of them was guilty. Our starting-point was to find
them. That was where organisation came in. The miniature helped me to
bluff Sir Ralph Fairfield into an admission that it was the portrait of
Lola of Vienna, and I purposely showed it to some newspaper men on a
pretext. One of them commented on the likeness to the Princess
Petrovska, who was staying at the Hotel Palatial, and I at once
telephoned to the hotel, and discovered that she was supposed to have
left at ten on the evening of the murder. A reference to the St.
Petersburg police gave us a few more facts about her. She became a
possibility as the veiled visitor.</p>

<p>"The finger-prints on the dagger, although we should have adopted a
different method had we known what we know now, helped us to narrow the
investigation, for they apparently&mdash;and actually by luck&mdash;settled the
innocence of several people who might have been suspected.</p>

<p>"Lady Eileen Meredith came to me with a story that seemed to implicate
Sir Ralph Fairfield. There seemed just a possibility that she was right,
for I could conceive jealousy might be a motive&mdash;though, of course,
there was so far nothing to explain why the master of the house and his
valet should take to flight. I took Sir Ralph's finger-prints by a ruse,
and to me that seemed fairly satisfactory proof<!-- Page 380 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span> that he was not the
man. Of course, I was then presuming that the finger-prints were those
of the murderer.</p>

<p>"Then I received information that Ivan and a man my informant took for
Goldenburg had been seen at Victoria Station on the night of the murder.
I managed to find Ivan and, by a threat, got a partly formed opinion
confirmed. He knew that the murdered man was not Mr. Grell. I took from
him the pearls that were to have formed a wedding present, and let him
go after taking his finger-prints. My idea was to have him watched, for
I felt confident that he was in touch with his master&mdash;whom I believed
to be the murderer.</p>

<p>"But it was not enough to follow one line. We used the fact of the
striking similarity of Grell and Goldenburg to advertise for the former
under the name of the latter. The mere fact of throwing the description
broadcast, was calculated to make any attempt to escape more difficult.
Meanwhile, we were making inquiries about every one concerned in the
case by co-operation of foreign police-forces, and particularly with the
help of Pinkerton's agency in the United States. It was all
organisation, you see&mdash;the individual counted for little.</p>

<p>"The first attempt to communicate with Fairfield failed, not through the
working of any miracle on our part, but by patient watching. I stole a
note from Fairfield, which gave us something to act upon, in the East
End. Remember, the immediate object of our search was Robert Grell&mdash;not
necessarily for the murderer. Do you follow?"<!-- Page 381 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span></p>

<p>"I think I do," answered Grell. "You wanted, at least, an explanation
from me."</p>

<p>"Precisely. Well, on top of that, we got a typewritten letter, informing
us of the kidnapping of Waverley. That letter was important, for its
contents showed that we were up against people who were absolutely
reckless. We were able to trace, too, a typewriting machine as having
been sold recently to a man named Israel, in Grave Street, There were
finger-prints on the letter, and they corresponded to those on the
dagger. As a matter of fact, I recently found out that the letter had
been written on paper given by you. You had torn a half-sheet from an
old letter, and I can only presume it was one that had been written to
you by Lady Eileen Meredith. For they were her finger-prints.</p>

<p>"We paid a surprise visit to Grave Street, and, although we were unable
to lay our hands on any one of much importance to the investigation, we
hit on the cipher with which it was intended to communicate with your
friends. Now, we had already, as you know, taken every precaution to
stop supplies. It was obvious that, sooner or later, money would be
wanted, and we rigorously watched the persons who were likely to be
applied to. Up to this point, circumstantial evidence pointed clearly to
you"&mdash;he nodded towards Grell&mdash;"as the murderer.</p>

<p>"Something of the sort happened, for Lola went to Lady Eileen, and we
were able to lay hands on her. But we failed to get her identified as
the veiled woman who had visited the house in Grosvenor Gardens. I will
confess that, at that time, I never had any sus<!-- Page 382 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span>picion that she was the
actual murderess. We had no adequate excuse for detaining her after she
handed the jewels over, with an explanation endorsed by Lady Eileen
Meredith. I had taken her finger-prints, and they did not agree.</p>

<p>"It was palpable that the attempt to baffle us was being shrewdly
organised. I tried a different way of getting information&mdash;an attack, so
to speak, by the back door. I enlisted the help of a criminal. He was
acting more or less blindly, but by his help we stopped the burglary
affair that was planned. In the pocket of one of the men we arrested, we
discovered two advertisements, worded so as to convey a cipher key
without exciting suspicion. We had them inserted, and naturally arranged
to keep an eye on the office&mdash;for the word to-morrow suggested one to be
inserted the following day.</p>

<p>"There is always wisdom in gaining the confidence of those concerned in
a case if you can. I was trying hard to establish friendly relations
with Lady Eileen and Sir Ralph Fairfield. Each was difficult to handle,
but with Sir Ralph I succeeded to some extent. I used him to try and
learn something from her. She realised that the cipher was known, and
went to the newspaper office to try and stop the insertion of the
advertisement that might enable us to find Grell. Of course she failed,
and we got a message which had been handed in by Petrovska. One of our
men followed her.</p>

<p>"We deciphered the message, and it enabled us to discover your
hiding-place on the river. But the business was muddled, and you got
away. We found the sheath of the knife used in the murder among<!-- Page 383 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span> other
belongings you left behind. By the way, we understand that that dagger
had belonged to Harry Goldenburg&mdash;how came it to be lying about your
room?"</p>

<p>Grell shook his head. "That is a mistake. The dagger was mine. It is
possible that he had a similar one."</p>

<p>"Yes, that is possible. But in the event, the point does not matter
much. What was more important was, that we had driven you out of a
secure hiding-place.</p>

<p>"Meanwhile, Pinkerton's had been hard at work on the other side of the
Atlantic, and many episodes of your private life were minutely examined.
Their detectives it was, too, who had discovered that Goldenburg and
Petrovska had in some way been associated with you. What they found out
pointed to blackmail. Here appeared an adequate motive for you to murder
Goldenburg."</p>

<p>Grell tapped impatiently on the table, but did not interrupt. Heldon
Foyle went on.</p>

<p>"We could not blind ourselves to the fact that you were not the type of
man who would commit an ordinary crime under stress of temptation. But
homicide is in a class by itself. You might have committed murder.
Indeed, there was the strongest possible assumption that you had done
so.</p>

<p>"You will observe that there was nothing miraculous in what we did. One
step led to another in natural sequence. On the barge, we got the letter
that led to the tracing of Ivan at the gambling-house in Smike Street.
We knew your finances were cramped. We<!-- Page 384 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span> were, as opportunity offered,
limiting your helpers, so that we might force you to show yourself.</p>

<p>"That is what happened. You went to Sir Ralph Fairfield, and succeeded
in dodging our men&mdash;so far. It was Fairfield's servant who gave you
away. He came to Scotland Yard and, in my absence, was taken away by Sir
Ralph. When I returned, I arranged to get Sir Ralph out of his chambers
for a time, sufficient to allow me a talk with his servant. I then
bluffed some idea of your mission out of Sir Ralph. I found you had been
refused money.</p>

<p>"You had already applied once to Lady Eileen Meredith for money. There
seemed a chance that, in your desperate state, you might do so again. I
went to Berkeley Square. Lady Eileen had gone out. I got into her
sitting-room on pretext of waiting for her. On the fire were fragments
of a note from you, and I was able to make clear several words.</p>

<p>"That made me determined to examine her desk. I found a cheque-book, but
the used counterfoils were not in her handwriting, nor did the amounts
and the people to whom they were payable seem those that would be found
in a personal cheque-book of hers. I searched the blotting-pad, and was
able to make out the words Burghley and &pound;200. The assumption I drew from
that was startling enough, but it was still more startling to discover
on the blotting-pad a finger-print which, as far as my recollection
went, corresponded with those on the dagger.</p>

<p>"Up to that moment, the possibility that Lady Eileen might be the guilty
person had not occurred to me. But now a rearrangement of the
circumstances,<!-- Page 385 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span> apart from the finger-print, began to throw a new light
on the matter. It would explain much if you, Mr. Grell, were shielding
Lady Eileen.</p>

<p>"I could think of no motive, however, and resolved to hold the matter
over for the time being. Even if I had good cause for my suspicion, it
was still essential to find you. You obviously held the key to the
mystery.</p>

<p>"We found out that you had met Lady Eileen, and driven to Kingston&mdash;not
by shadowing, for our man failed there&mdash;but by getting hold of the
cabman who drove you. With the aid of the provincial police, we were
able to trace you to Dalehurst Grange. I feared that you might be on the
alert for any step taken by Mr. Green, and so acted by myself in getting
into the house.</p>

<p>"Your manner, when I confronted you, impressed me favourably. It was not
that of a guilty man. But I could not let an opinion bias me, for, in
spite of everything, you might still have been guilty. There was a great
possibility that you were an accessory.</p>

<p>"One thing struck me. Your walk was uncommonly like that of Harry
Goldenburg. Now, people may be uncommonly like each other in face and
figure and be unrelated. But I have noticed often that little
peculiarities of gait, run through a family. I had thought you might be
a relative of Goldenburg's, but not till that moment did I become
certain of it. You will remember that I put some questions that might
have seemed offensive. I wanted you to lose your temper&mdash;it was
conceivable that you might blurt out something.</p>

<p>"I found it very difficult to place Petrovska. While<!-- Page 386 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span> you were asleep, I
thought the matter over and formed an hypothesis. I put several
questions to you later, and found that a woman had visited your house
with Goldenburg. That was Lola Petrovska. Now, if she was not the veiled
woman who came later, who was? For the sake of my theory, I put her as
Lady Eileen.</p>

<p>"Very well. Lola and Goldenburg had visited you together. But she had
assisted you since the murder, and she was hardly likely to do that if
she was on friendly terms with the blackmailer and knew you had killed
him. So it came to my mind that you might have used her in an attempt to
get the compromising letters. And then it occurred as a remote
possibility that she might, after all, be the guilty person, but, to
assume that, it was necessary to explain away the finger-prints&mdash;for
they were not hers.</p>

<p>"All this led to the supposition that the dagger had been handled by
some one <i>after</i> the crime. That person must have been Lady
Eileen&mdash;therefore she must have been the veiled woman&mdash;you see?</p>

<p>"But this was supposition, which a single fresh fact would destroy. I
held on to you, and Lola walked into our trap. An interview with Ivan
cleared up some of the vague points in the story, and confirmed my
theory&mdash;you will understand that I was ready to drop it the moment it
failed to fit the facts. Indeed, to make assurance more sure, I sent a
story out to the papers, which I felt sure would convey to Lady Eileen
Meredith that you were in great peril&mdash;and which, if she was guilty,
might induce her to confess to save you. It had an effect rather
different to that which I intended.<!-- Page 387 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span></p>

<p>"Your clumsy attempts to take the guilt on yourself made me more sure
than ever of your innocence. This morning we laid a trap for Lola. She
was suddenly aroused out of her sleep, and I surprised her into what
amounted to an admission of guilt."</p>

<p>Grell rose from his chair with extended hand. "I rather believe that I
have made a fool of myself," he said. "You have done a great deal more
than you adopt credit for. I cannot thank you now, but later&mdash;I suppose
I am at liberty now. I must see Ei&mdash;Lady Eileen at once."</p>

<p>"You will have to give evidence at the inquest," said Thornton. "That is
all. The step this woman has taken will save us all a great deal of
trouble. Of course, what Mr. Foyle has told you is entirely
confidential."</p>

<p>"Of course."</p>

<p>"Lady Eileen is here, if you would care to see her now," said Foyle.
"Will you come with me?"</p>

<p>Grell followed the superintendent along the corridor. At the door of his
own room, Heldon Foyle stopped and knocked.</p>

<p>"Here you are," he said.</p>

<p>Robert Grell opened the door.</p>

<i>foot-prints of a girl</i>. And the girl proved to be lovely, piquant, and
the trail of these girlish foot-prints led the young engineer a madder
chase than "the trail of the lonesome pine."</p>

his meagre past, express the love, the passion and the tragedies of life
and all its happy phases as can the master who has lived life in all its
fulness. But a girl comes into his life&mdash;a beautiful bit of human
driftwood that his aunt had taken into her heart and home, and through
his passionate love for her, he learns the lessons that life has to
give&mdash;and his soul awakes.</p>

<p>Founded on a fact that all artists realize.</p>
